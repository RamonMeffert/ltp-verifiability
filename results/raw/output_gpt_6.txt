Comment: I have spent 6 years at 2 different universities and I have seen maybe 4 posters advertising safe spaces in some small club room for a short scheduled time, so I don't really understand the idea that safe spaces are interfering with anyone's expression.

Comment: It's awful that this concept has turned into either "if you don't follow my rules you're a bigoted asshole who deserves to die" or "if you don't listen to me then you're a fucking bitch who can't handle negative comments. (Verifiability: Unverifiable)
