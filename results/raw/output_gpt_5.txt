Can the following sentence be verified: "I don't really know what you're talking about" or "
 No.

I'm thinking of doing this with a list of words/phrases/sentences and then going from there. Any suggestions?

A:

The first part of the question is very broad, but you can do this.
I think you can do this, but you have to think about whether you want to add the word "if" before the sentence, or after.  I think the first is very clear.
I think the second is a bit weird because it is a little bit vague.
Some other ideas:
1. This is more readable:

The airlines do not want to ban peanuts from their flights for fear of causing allergies
  of passengers.

or

The airlines do not want to ban peanuts from their flights for fear of causing allergies which some passengers may be allergic to.

2. This is a little bit more readable:

Since then, his levels of IGA (which is a measure of a person's sensitivity to the peanut) have continued to go up.

<|endoftext|>
 No.

So I would think it's a possibility that some of the comments are going through the filter of the original poster.

<|endoftext|>
 No.

A:

There is no such thing as a free lunch.  If you want to spend the least, you must first pay for the most.  And you cannot just eat free if you are spending money on something else.
As stated in your question, the only way to be able to receive a free airfare is to have a ticket for a specific fare.  There is no way to get a free travel voucher if you don't have a ticket.  The airlines cannot do this.
It is true that if a person is financially strapped, they have a right to know about the pricing.  But that is not the same as a legal obligation.  Since the airlines will charge whatever the airlines deem is fair, the consumer has a right to know what the airlines are charging.  That is a private matter for the airline and it is not a matter the courts can decide.
Some other comments:

Did you know that if you have a ticket for a specific flight, the airline will charge you based on seats occupied in the aircraft?  If you are not using the seat, you are not charged for it.  That is one of the reasons why you should buy airline tickets before you travel.
If you are not planning to stay more than 24 hours, you will not get any free airfare.  So, if you are not planning to stay 24 hours longer than you are flying, you would not get a free free hotel stay.  That is another private matter.
If you decide to use a hotel room, you are not allowed to make a reservation for a specific hotel.  You can only book a room based on the airline's website.  And you cannot book a room based on the hotel's website.  A hotel can only book a room based on the hotel's website.

I hope you find this helpful.

Can the following sentence be verified: "Most of
 Yes.

A:

The question is worded extremely badly.
The correct sentence, as written, is:

"Try a debate team or something".

And, for the record, I don't agree that TSA should have "created something" to compensate for the price discrepancy.  

A:

Try a debate team or something

Is trying a debate team or something, but not an actual debate team.

And, for the record, I don't agree that TSA should have "created something" to compensate for the price discrepancy.

No, it's not creating anything. The fact is that TSA does the same sort of thing it does every day, but for a different reason. TSA does not make any money on the price disparity. TSA does not charge anything to passengers who come into its airports. 
All of the other factors that you mention seem correct, and a large amount of research has come up with the same conclusion. 

<|endoftext|>
 No.

A:

The other answers seem to fall into the gap between the second and fourth sentences, which is where the problem lies. I have a suggestion:

[...] because it is very unlikely that other options such as travel insurance, car rental, hotel, or any other form of travel will be a factor in such a scenario.

I am not a native English speaker, so please excuse my poor English. A native English speaker should recognize what I am trying to say.
Let me restate the question:

Is the sentence "All airlines should be required to present fuel surcharge separately, along with other taxes or fees details." grammatically correct?

If not, then the second sentence is incorrect, and the third is incorrect.

Why is it difficult to give a complete example? 

Let me restate the question:

Is the sentence "All airlines should be required to present fuel surcharge separately, along with other taxes or fees details" grammatically correct?

And, to be even clearer:

Is the sentence "All airlines should be required to present fuel surcharge separately, along with other taxes or fees details" grammatically correct as written?

I think the answer to this question is yes.

A:

I think it's OK to say that "All airlines should be required to present fuel surcharge separately, along with other taxes or fees details." is correct. But it's not grammatical.
If this were a question from a native speaker, I'd expect them to say that "All airlines should be required to present fuel surcharge separately, along with other taxes or fees details." is incorrect.
This is not something I have encountered in a graduate grammar class. I would expect that the student is aware of the distinction between the second and third sentence. I think they're just asking for something that the speaker does not intend to say, so it's fine to say "All airlines should be required to present fuel surcharge separately, along with other taxes or fees details."
In the same way, I think that the speaker is being extremely sloppy when they say that "The issue is that it seems unreasonable to expect travelers to fly without any luggage." and then state that it's "heart-breaking to think that our child will not get to experience the world.".
"In the same way" is saying "This is the same thing." and then saying "Don't say it this way, don't say this way." and then saying "Don't say this way, don't say this way." etc.

Could the following sentence be verified: "The food
 Yes.
Can the following sentence be verified: "The bank will be penalized on the loan and the entire loan process will be deemed invalid
 No.

A:

I think it would be a stretch to say there is a difference, but I would say there is no difference between "absorb" and "trap". 
Traditionally, "absorb" has been used to refer to the process of absorbing or trapping chemicals, while "trap" has been used to refer to the actual physical substance that is "absorbed". 
But, in the case of this question, what they really mean is that they are claiming that there is no difference in absorption versus trapping/evaporation. 
The idea that some of these peanuts might be absorbed or trapped is highly suspect. 
A very common problem with peanuts is the formation of small, but harmful, clumps of the shell. If the shell fragments that you mentioned in the question are the result of the evaporation of the peanuts, then it is highly unlikely that that was the source of the problem.

I am not sure this is a very good question, and not one to have been asked on this blog before. The fact that I have asked a question, and that such a question has been asked on this blog, makes me suspect that I am asking a very poor question.

Let me first answer the question you asked, and then explain myself.

I am a student of the English language. I am a student of the rules of grammar. I am a student of the rules of syntax. I am a student of the rules of communication.

I have long argued that the question you asked is not valid. I have stated many times that the rules I am using here are not valid. I have stated many times that I am not going to use them. I have made the same argument many, many, times.

I am not going to give you any examples of valid questions. I am going to give you examples of questions that are not answers to questions that are valid. In this case, however, I am going to give you an example of a question that is valid, and then explain why it is invalid.

I do not expect that a student of English, a student of the rules of grammar, would be interested in learning about the rules of syntax. I do not even think they would be interested in learning about the rules of grammar.

I do expect, however, that a student of English, a student of the rules of syntax, would be interested in learning about the rules of communication. I do expect that a student of English, a student of the rules of communication, would be interested in learning about the rules of communication.

It is not valid. I will explain why.

I am going to make three arguments against the rules I am using. (1) I am not using the rules perfectly. (2) The rules are not the best. (3) The rules do not make any sense.

Let's start with the rules I am using.

I am using the rules of grammar. This is a rule that every student of English should know. The rules of grammar are not the rules of English. English is a language that has rules. The rules of grammar are not the rules of English.

I am using the rules of syntax only occasionally. I am using the rules of syntax only when I want to use certain words in a specific way. The rules of syntax are not the rules of English. English is a language that has rules. The rules of syntax are not the rules of English.

I am using the rules of communication only occasionally. I am using the rules of communication when I need to talk to a person or a computer. The rules of communication are not the rules of English. English is a language that has rules


If not, what is the explanation for this?

If they don't have 3 hours then why did they book us a flight that didn't have 3 hours?

If they don't have 3 hours, then why did they book us a flight that didn't have 3 hours?

It seems like a contradiction.

A:

First of all, you need to realize that you are asking a question that's not really addressed by a simple yes/no question.  
Yes, all planes should have 3 hours of flight time.
No, one of them should have 3 hours of flight time.

This is a tricky question because there's a lot of nuance between "all planes should have 3 hours of flight time" and "all planes should have 3 hours of flight time".  There aren't really two distinct sentences, so either of these two sentences is fine.  But neither sentence is correct.

You are not alluding to any kind of rule about how the 3-hour time limit should be arrived up.  It's actually just a guideline.  In fact, in some instances, a flight that's already 3 hours in may actually be over 3 hours before the end of the flight.  So, you should just be aware of that.

I'm not really sure about this.

The above sentence is a question.

All flights should have the 3 hour time limit, including international.

There are two different types of questions.  One is a yes/no question, and the other is a question with all kinds of nuances.

This is a question asking for a specific piece of information.  The other type of question is a question about the meaning of a sentence.  This sentence is not asking for a specific piece of information, but it does ask you to judge the sentence based on a particular rule.

All flights should have the 3 hour time limit, including international.

All flights should have 3 hours of flight time.

The question is: Can the following sentence be verified:

With nearly 2 million peanut allergic people out there?

The answer is: yes. We have the word "peanut" in the question, but the word is not necessary. We can also say

With nearly 2 million peanut allergic people out there,

or (more simply)

Nearly 2 million peanut allergic people out there,

These sentences are grammatically equivalent. They both contain the word "peanut" and the word is not necessary. We can also say

These sentences are grammatically equivalent. They both contain the word "peanut" and the word is not necessary. We can also say

The idea is to put the question of 'who owns the earth' back in the hands of the people.

The answer is: Yes, we need the word "ownership" as the root of ownership, which we add to both sentences. This is the correct answer.

Can the following sentence be verified: With nearly 2 million peanut allergic people out there,

The answer is: No. We do not have the word "peanut" in this sentence. We can only speak of an allergic response. The sentence is very, very wrong, because "almost" is not a conjunction.

The answer is: No. We do not have the word "peanut" in this sentence either. We can only speak of local characteristics of the area.

A:

The first sentence is correct.
The last sentence is not correct. It's not possible to make an assumption about a movie with a QWR unless the borrower (the person who must pay to see a movie) is the one who is being charged for using their credit card and is paying for the movie.

A:

No.
The last sentence is not correct. The last sentence is not a sentence that allows you to know whether the movie is good or bad. The last sentence is not a sentence that allows you to know whether the borrower is being charged for using his credit card or his bank's credit card.
The first sentence is correct. The first sentence is a sentence that allows you to know whether the movie is good or bad. The first sentence is not a sentence that allows you to know whether the borrower is being charged for using his credit card or his bank's credit card.

"Baggage fees" is just a phrase; it is not a definition. You can say what you like, but you can't say what it means. At most, you could say that they are asking for a reasonable "baggage exception", because that is what the phrase means. But you can't say "I don't have a problem with baggage fees", as you've done.
"Baggage fees" can mean either "baggage fees" or "baggage allowances". It would be a perfectly reasonable phrase for what it means, but you can't use it as a definition.

This isn't a good answer, but as a brief overview of how a few airline websites work.

I don't have a problem with baggage fees, except there should be a
  reasonable "baggage exception" before fees are imposed

The answer to this question is that you don't have a problem with baggage fees, but that there should be a baggage fee before they are imposed.

When an airline "bumps" a passenger it is, in essence, "buying" that ticket back from the passenger to sell it to someone else, and then "purchasing" a new ticket for the bumped passenger on the next available flight.

I have just received the results of the exam which was given on Saturday. I know that the teacher wants to make it up to me so I am not disappointed but I was thinking that I need to start with the next question because I have not been given it yet.

Thank you for sharing your experience!! In this exam, the teacher asked a question and the examiner gave a number to the correct answer. The examiner then asked if the correct answer was correct.

 Yes.

What does not have a verb in it:  
Why does "what's the plan" occur in the sentence?  
What is the reason the "plan" can have no verb in it?  
What is the reason the "plan" can have no verb in it?  
What is the reason the "plan" can have no verb in it?  
How can a passive voice be used in this case?

A:

You are correct in that the sentence is ambiguous; there are at least three possibilities. I will try to refer to each of them only.

The plane is being re-boarded and everyone is back on it.
The plane is re-boarded and everyone is back on it.
The plane is being re-boarded and everyone on it.  

I'll assume the first sentence is correct and, as it is, it is a correct translation of the original version.

The plane has been re-boarded. It's being re-boarded, and everyone is back on it.

This sentence would be grammatically correct except for the incorrect "and".

The plane has been re-boarded and everyone is back on it.

This would be grammatically correct.

The plane has been re-boarded and everyone is back on it. The plane is being re-boarded, and everyone is back on it.

This would be grammatically correct, but would be awkward when spoken by speakers other than the speaker.

A:

The plane is being re-boarded and everyone is back on it.

The plane is re-boarded and everyone is back on it.

The plane is being re-boarded and everyone is back on it.

This construction is a bit ambiguous, for which a simple sentence with just "the" is the usual way to say this. However, as @RK's answer shows, there are other verbs that can be used with this construction
 Yes.
Is the following sentence true or false? The flight to Japan was delayed because of a terrorist attack.

A:

The sentence

After all, no one NEEDS to wear perfumes or eat nuts.

is not grammatically correct as a whole, and is a direct quote.

You should use

After all, no one NEEDS to wear perfumes or eat nuts.

instead, for a sentence containing the adverb 'need' in the first position.

 No.

A:

Your question is about the ability of the sentence to refer to a particular flight. There's no such thing as a "peanut-free (or) not." It's a bit like asking about the weather, and then saying "We're going to the beach today." Neither are specific weather conditions.
To answer your question, "flight should be peanut-free or not" is a phrase, not a sentence. It tells you what to do, not what to do. You could say " flight should be allowed to take us to the beach," which is a more general statement.
To answer your question, "flight should be peanut-free or not" is a statement, not a question.

A:

If you mean to ask whether a particular flight is peanut-free, then the answer is no.
If you mean to ask whether a particular flight is allowed to take you to the beach, then the answer is no.
If you mean to ask whether airlines should only be allowed to change prices once a week, then the answer is no.
If you mean to ask whether two routes should be on the same plane, then the answer is no.
To answer your question about the weather, you get the weather.

I'd like to know how you can verify the four answers provided. You can't, because they're not correct.
From a service provider's perspective, it is very simple for a large or small servicer to create letter templates and systematically fill in the appropriate dates, amounts, customer info, etc.

It is not. It sounds like you have made an incomplete and inaccurate statement that the "servicer" is unaware of. The phrase "servicer" is a generic term for any service provider, not a specific service provider (a specific servicer is a specific service provider).

From a customer's perspective, it is very simple for a large or small servicer to create letter templates and systematically fill in the appropriate dates, amounts, customer info, etc.

It is not. You should have read the question carefully before you continue with the answer, because the question is about the airline and not about the airline's customer service.

From a servicer's perspective, it is very simple for a large or small servicer to create letter templates and systematically fill in the appropriate dates, amounts, customer info, etc.

The phrase "servicer" is a generic term for any service provider, not a specific servicer.

The answer does not say that the airline "needs" a specific servicer to create a letter template, nor does it say that there are no "small" or "large" servicers that can do that. It simply says that there are no "small" or "large" servicers and that it is not part of the airline's current service delivery processes to create letter templates.

From a customer's perspective, it is very simple for a large or small servicer to create letter templates and systematically fill in the appropriate dates, amounts, customer info, etc.

It is not. No one is claiming that the airline is unaware of the work that may be required to create letter templates.
It is not. You should have read the question carefully before you continue with the answer, because the question is about the airline and not about the airline's customer service.

A:

"servicer" is a generic term that refers to any service provider, not a specific service provider.

From a customer's perspective, it is very simple for a large or small servicer to create letter templates and systematically fill in the appropriate dates, amounts, customer info, etc.

Not true. Servicers are specialists with specific expertise in certain parts of the airline's delivery process. By that definition, a small servicer wouldn't be a servicer at all. 

A:

From a servicer's perspective, it is very simple for a large or small servicer to create letter templates and systematically fill in the appropriate dates, amounts, customer info, etc.

So what? I don't use that service provider's terminology. 
That is what we do (and what you should do) if you work for a company that provides certain services. You don't write your own letter templates and then implement them. 
That is what we do with customers who tell us what they want, and we implement the product they say they want.

Can the following sentence be verified: "I do not believe a complete ban
 No.

A:

No.  The sentences are technically correct, but the order of the first two parts is not what you might expect.
The first sentence is the main one.  The second sentence may be a separate question, with additional information, but it is not related to the first one.  The first sentence starts with an adverbial statement, which is not an element of the second part, unless the words "as a result" or "because" are used.
The second sentence might be a separate question, with additional information, but the order of the questions is not what you might expect.  The second sentence starts with an adverbial phrase, which is an element of the first part.  The words "a result" or "because" are not parts of the second part.  
The sentences are technically correct, but the order of the first two parts is not what you might expect.

A:

The first sentence is fine, but the phrasing "The proof is in the pudding so to speak" is incorrect. What is supposed to be a result of this research is a result of the research, not a cause of the research. There should be a modifier, possibly "because", after "the pudding" to suggest that this is a result of the research. In your example sentence, "a result" is not a part of "the pudding so to speak", so I expect that "the pudding" is a complete sentence, and the modifier is superfluous.
And the second sentence is fine, but the "because" in the second sentence is redundant. The best way to convey the idea of a result is to put in an exclamation point because it's a good idea to think in terms of "a result" in this case. The last sentence should have been the second one, and should also read "But", not "but as a result."

A:

The most common reason is because the original research was done, or was done to achieve something, not as a result of the research. The following two sentences also work correctly:

The study was done.
The study was done to achieve something.

The last sentence, "but as a result" is not only correct, but also idiomatic, so that is a very good choice.
As a matter of fact, your question can be solved in a logical way, too. In your sentence, "the pudding" is a complete sentence. Therefore, you can say:

The pudding was a result of research.

In this case, the sentence with the modifier "while doing research" can be substituted.

 Yes.

I have come to realize that the wording of the question is not very clear. I would like to see what can be done about this to make the conversation more productive. (I've noticed the phrasing of the question from the comments has changed.)

A:

The phrasing of the question is not too clear.  I think it is best to address the question as something like:

As a physician, what are your thoughts about what your airline should 
  do to help alleviate peanut sensitivities in your passengers?

(The part about being "very worried" about peanuts is only relevant if that is indeed the case.)
In your specific example, it seems that the phrasing is ambiguous.  My first thought is that to be honest, the question might be clearer as:

As a physician, what are your thoughts about what your airline should
  do to help alleviate peanut sensitivities in your passengers?

That is, I agree with the first part of the question, but would make it clearer that you are addressing the second part.  I would also mention that it is not clear what the "other plans" are.
The first part of the question could be rephrased as:

As a physician, what are your thoughts about what your airline should 
  do to help alleviate peanut sensitivities in your passengers?

I think the second part of the question is not as clear.  The statement about the "other plans" is unclear, but I would probably say something like "I recommend that you make sure anyone who has a peanut allergy is on a flight to that destination," or "I believe that airlines should do whatever they can to accommodate passengers with peanut allergies."

There is a lot to consider when answering these questions. Which of the following is NOT a valid response to the question "What are the most common ways airlines overbook in the United States?"

1. Overbooking on domestic flights is something that happens from time to time.
2. Domestic airlines occasionally overbook.
3. Airlines do not book flights after all flights have left the airport.
4. These airlines only overbook for a very short period of time.
5. Airlines would only overbook after all other airlines have left the airport.
6. When the airline does overbook they will typically not book all flights leaving the airport.
7. Airlines will only overbook flights after all other airlines have already left the airport.
8. Airlines will only overbook flights departing the airport.
9. Airlines always overbook flights after all flights have left the airport.
10. Airlines will only book flights after all flights have left the airport.

The only airline that would be considered "overbooking" is the one in row 4.

The airline in row 7 would be considered "underbooking." Which of the following would NOT be considered an overbooking event?

"The airline industry would like for force-placed insurance to be eliminated."

If so, it sounds like it's only the insurance industry. How would the airline industry eliminate force placed insurance, exactly? It seems to me that the airline industry would find a way to get rid of force placed insurance.

You should be able to come up with some ideas that may work better than others. I think I know how this can be done. For example, instead of saying "no more pay to play, no more back dated insurance, no more over priced insurance where consumers are taken advantage of at the lowest point in their lives, no changing insurance companies after foreclosure is initiated," it could be said something like this:

"As a result, the airline does not have to bear the risk of force placed insurance."

Or, even better, do away with the phrase "no more pay to play, no more back dated insurance, no more over priced insurance where consumers are taken advantage of at the lowest point in their lives, no changing insurance companies after foreclosure is initiated." and replace it with something like this:

"As a result, the airline does not have to bear the risk of force placed insurance, provided that the insurance companies are forced to abide by the terms of the force placed contract."

I would bet the airline industry would prefer to eliminate force placed insurance rather than get rid of pay to play, back dated insurance, over priced insurance where consumers are taken advantage of at the lowest point in their lives, and changing insurance companies after foreclosure is initiated.

I would bet the airline industry would prefer to eliminate force placed insurance rather than get rid of pay to play, back dated insurance, overpriced insurance where consumers are taken advantage of at the lowest point in their lives, and changing insurance companies after foreclosure is initiated.

I understand that your sentence-spelling may have affected your response. But I am unable to find any cases in which the word "I" was used to qualify a particular part of a sentence.
I am asking for a clarification of what's going on here.

A:

The correct spelling is I

I am asking for a clarification of what's going on here.

Your sentence is grammatically correct. However, I can't imagine a reason why you would want to use the word 'I' instead of a possessive pronoun like 'I'.

<|endoftext|>


A:

Your examples are very much correct, but the reason they are incorrect is because they would take place at a ball park, and do not apply to other environments, such as in a car.
An example of this is the example sentence you provided:

There have been reactions in situations where a person is exposed to a large amount of airborne peanut protein
  when multiple bags of peanuts are opened at once. For instance: at a ball park.

I'm not sure where you got this example from, but it's not grammatically correct.  The correct way to say it would be:

There have been reactions in situations where a person is exposed to large amounts of airborne peanut protein when several bags of peanuts are opened simultaneously. For example: at a ball park.

In this example, the only thing that is not covered is the fact that a person can be "exposure" to a large amount of airborne peanut protein, as opposed to a ball park, where there is no possibility of this.

A:

If you read the definition of "verification":

A declaration of fact or opinion, as to the correctness of which the

The sentence you have is a declaration of fact or opinion, as to the correctness of which the statement is the assertion of which the statement is the assertion.
It is not a statement of fact or opinion.
It is not an assertion.
It is not a denial.
It is not an assertion that something is true.
It does not assert that something is true.
It does not assert that something is false.

The correct phrase is "as to the correctness of which the statement is the assertion."
As to the correct meaning, it is the opposite of a verifiably true statement.

A:

One way to think of this is that the sentence is:

The price is set after the date of the contract.

It is also possible that the sentence is:

The price is set after the date of the contract, because the airline changed the dates.

Both of these statements seem to make sense to me.  The former means that the price is set after the date of contract, and the latter means that the price is set after the date of the contract, because the airline changed the dates.  This is probably because the sentence is a question that has to be answered.

So, you're absolutely right that there's a question about this, and you're absolutely right that the OP has a real problem. But I'm sorry, what's the solution?

A:

In my opinion, we should just stop using these questions. 
Yes, the question asks for some form of guidance, but it doesn't seem to be on-topic. 
I'm not sure what the solution is, but I think that the best answer is to not answer the question at all. If someone asks this question on a site that the asker is comfortable with, I'm sure that there will be some people who will be willing to answer the question, but I don't think that this is the case here.
I don't think it is the best solution to try and answer questions like this every single time there's a question like this.

A:

I've been thinking about this too, and I think we should drop this question.

I think it's a good idea to consider the possibility that this question is asking for guidance or advice, and I think it's also a good idea to consider the possibility that there is a solution to this question that is not the best answer. 
But there is a problem with the problem itself. 

This question is asking for guidance or advice. This question is not asking for guidance or advice. 
There is a good answer to this question. 

There are other questions that ask for guidance or advice. 

But the problem is that, if we assume that, all the questions about this question are asking for advice, then the question is not on topic. This question is asking for guidance or advice. But the question is also asking for guidance or advice. It's not asking for guidance or advice. 
I think we should consider this a dupe of the previous question. 

So we should just drop this question.

A:

We should drop the question. 

...which is not an answer to the question in the first place.

I think this actually has an answer that can stand on its own.

Why? 

People are asking for guidance. 
We can't really answer the question if there is no guidance.

I think this has to do with the term "normal" versus "normal" which is defined as:

"A normal" is an acceptable rate of price under certain conditions and "normal" is a rate of price which is within the average range for the type of goods and services in question. 

The definition does not include the question of "reasonable efforts" so I am not sure what the criteria are. 

A:

It doesn't matter.

This seems like
  the most efficient way to
  make the information available to
  the public.

There are other more efficient ways to make the information available, but since you have specified "is the most efficient way to make the information available", you will not have to worry about it.

This will ensure that the
  borrower will not get caught up in
  a dispute between services.

This is again a case of "do not worry about it" since you say it will ensure that the borrower will not get caught up in disputes between services, rather than being caught up in disputes between airlines.

<|endoftext|>
 Yes.

A:

This is a good question, and the question is quite open-ended.  There are two answers:

Nope.  It's not technically incorrect since the phrase "if compensated properly" is being used as a synonym of "if compensated appropriately", and thus has the same meaning.
There's absolutely no harm in what you wrote, but there's a harm in the word "compensated".  If we were talking about a "compromised" airline ticket, I would go with "compromised" and not "compensated".  On the other hand, the airline ticket is probably being "compensated" as a business transaction, and you're talking to a business about a business transaction.  I think your answer would be no.
Nope.

It all depends on why the airline is compensating.  They could be compensating to help cover the costs of the ticket (e.g., for the fuel, which costs money), or maybe they're just trying to prevent a passenger from getting on the plane already on time.  Or they could be compensating for an inordinate delay in their flight schedule.  Or they could be compensating for an inordinate delay in the aircraft.  Or maybe they're compensating for the inconvenience of the plane coming in late, so that passengers are able to sleep on the plane.
In either case, there's no harm in what you wrote.  You're just describing a situation that exists, and your point is that there's no harm in what you're describing.

A:

No, the answer is: The company has no choice. But this depends whether you take this into account.
In the first example, it would be perfectly OK to make the reservation after the flight and not to arrive at the airport before the flight and there would be no harm (in a legal sense) if the airline company compensates or not.
In the second example, if you arrive late, the airline would have a problem (in a business sense). If you arrive early, the airline company would have a problem (in a business sense). I don't know what would come out of that.

EDIT: If you want to say that the airline would have an obligation to compensate (or would have to compensate) but the compensation they are giving is just a "nice" thing (e.g. the meal is tasty and the seats are comfortable), then you would be wrong. In the case of a good meal and comfortable seats,
 No.
Can the following sentence be verified: "It has been interesting for me
 Yes.
Can
 Yes.
Could someone please give me a bit of help on this?

A:

The first two sentences are correct, although the last one is a little bit strange. I recommend the following:

All airlines, when faced with an unresponsive passenger, can be expected to have someone in the back of the plane come and pick up the passenger.

This sentence is a little bit confusing:

But the system is designed to bring more revenue to the servicer if the borrower is late or in default.

It's a little bit of a misnomer since it's referring to the airline's own policies, not the general consumer.

If the airline's policies and customs are so stringent that they need to ensure that there is no passenger available, then there are other solutions. The airline itself can provide a standby passenger, who will be allowed to remain seated with the passenger while the passenger is being loaded and unloaded, and who can be brought into the cabin when the passenger is finally seated.

The airline can also do this by requiring that all the passengers have checked bags before boarding. This will require a passenger to check a bag at the check-in desk, but the passenger is not required to carry the bag. The airline can also offer to pick up a passenger in a wheelchair, as long as the passenger is checked in for the flight. This also requires the passenger to check a bag at the check-in desk, but the passenger is not required to carry the bag.

A:

Yes, that is the case.  The airline is still liable and has a duty to act reasonably.  There are two possible responses:

The airline is required to provide a standby passenger to make sure the passenger is not delayed or otherwise inconvenienced.  This is the 'no standby passenger' solution, you could also refer to this as a no-flight standby passenger option, but it is more common.
The airline is not required to provide a standby passenger (or no-flight standby passenger) but can do so so long as it is reasonable.  This is the 'passengers may be delayed but the airline doesn't have to provide a standby passenger' solution, you could also refer to this as the no-flight passengers option, although it doesn't apply to some airlines.

As for the question regarding the last question, it is a little bit unclear what you are asking.  It is a matter of policy, not a matter of fact.  Many different airlines have different policies and different customs about what is acceptable.  You can find the policies and customs of each airline at the airline's website if you are interested.  Some airlines allow passengers to check bags, some don't.  Some allow a wheelchair user to sit in the front row (or front door) while they are in the air.  Some require a standing passenger to wait for the customer to clear the luggage.  In short, the airline is free to change its policy or customs.  The policy is that there is no obligation to provide a standby passenger at all.

A:

No, the airlines are liable for the passengers with no available seats.  However they are required to make available the seats they have in their inventory.  The passengers with no available seats are not an inconvenience to the airline, they do not provide a standby passenger and there is no need to provide a standby passenger.
And yes
 Yes.

A:

We have a rule in the US, that when someone has a condition that can cause an immediate reaction to a medication, that they are considered to be 'allergic' (or rather, 'allergen-sensitive'). It's not to be confused with 'allergic disease' because that's not the same thing.
The definition you have given is the one that applies for other countries, but not for the US. As for the other things you ask about, the answer is: 

No.
No.
Yes.
No.
Yes.

A:

Yes, yes and yes are all correct and all would imply that the phrase allergic reactions includes allergic conditions.

We found out that my son had a peanut allergy.
We found out that my son had a peanut allergy.
We found out that our son had a peanut allergy.
He has a peanut allergy.

From other perspectives, yes is not the best answer as many would argue that it is too vague, whereas yes is correct.
The other answers are correct.

A:

Yes, yes and yes are the ones that are correct, and yes would imply that the phrase allergic reactions includes allergic conditions.
Yes is not good because people will ask you, "what does it mean?".  Yes does not answer your question: "What does allergic reactions include?"

<|endoftext|>
 No
 Yes.
So what this tells us is that there are at least some words that you can use to avoid the use of a peanut-free area, and some words that will cause you to be "prepared." In other words, you should be able to make sure that you have the proper words to address a situation.

A:

No answers
A common mistake:

As they say in the BSA, "Be Prepared"

The BSA refers to the Standard Airline Guides.  You don't mention which ones, but it also does not say what it means.
If you want to see what the BSA says, refer to the link I provide here.  Basically, it has the following definitions of the terms used in it:

"Be Prepared"
                      or
"Be Prepared Enough"

"Be Prepared Enough" means:

Is enough information to have you ready to board your flight or to use your seat(s)?

Have you checked with your airline travel agent or with the airline that is in charge of the airline?

Is it clear that you have checked with the airline to see if they plan to allow peanuts or peanuts in your seat?

Is it clear that you have checked with that airline to see if they plan to allow peanuts or peanuts in your seat?

Is it clear that you have seen the airline to see if they plan to allow peanuts or peanuts in your seat?

Is it clear that the airline has confirmed that peanuts will not be allowed in your seat?

Is it clear that the airline has confirmed that peanuts will not be allowed in your seat?
Can I use "be prepared" to refer to not being certain of what they plan to allow for peanuts?

Was your airline notified to the proper authorities of what you are carrying when you check in?

Was there an aircraft inspection to verify that the peanuts will not be allowed on board?

Was there an aircraft inspection to verify that the peanuts will not be allowed on board?

Was there a passenger safety inspection of the aircraft?

Was the aircraft inspected before the flight?

Was the aircraft inspected at a time when the peanuts are not allowed?

Was the passenger checked with the proper authority of the airline to see what kind of peanuts are allowed?

Did the airline advise you to carry peanuts?

Was the airline advise you to carry peanuts?

Was the airline advise you to carry peanuts?

The person responding to the ad is not the one who has the allergy, but the one responding to the question because the person has the allergy is the one who is going to be diagnosed with the allergy.

A:

I guess we should assume that you mean the following:

I am the poster child for mortgage abuse, having found crime in almost every category, in reference to my home loan.

A. No, because the phrase "mortgage abuse" doesn't have an unambiguous definition.  It actually has two of them:

The practice of misusing the terms and conditions of a loan to exploit a person's health or financial vulnerability.  
Misusing the terms and conditions of a loan after the borrower has already defaulted on it.

So since I think that "mortgage abuse" is a legitimate term, it's not a problem that you've raised.

 Yes.

I would read your last two sentences as "I can't believe you said that".  I couldn't believe that you could say that.  I can believe that you said it, but it came out differently.

A:

The closest I can come to a verbatim translation is:
"Adding mortgage or insurance information should not be difficult and should already have been done"

"adding" means to add something to, for example, a list, a bag of groceries, or a bag of pretzels
"should" means must, should be, must like, have to, must be, etc.
"information" means the information itself.

A:

A few suggestions:

Adding a mortgage application form to the database is an obvious task, and is already done (or not done) in most cases. 
As a traveler, I'm sympathetic to the problems that can arise, but I believe it's a no brainer that we are a great investment. 

I agree that the first two questions can be expressed either as they are written, or by "adding" to "should" or "information."  I agree that the last one can be expressed as it is written, or by "having the added information," or "having the added information."

A:

My two suggestions are:

A:

The key to the question, the answer to which is "Yes", is knowing the difference between "legal" and "illegal" and not trying to be too precise about the differences. The term "illegal" is typically used in courtrooms for the use of illegal methods, in an area of law when something is clearly illegal, or when the court is making a legal determination. The term "legal" is used generally in everyday language when there is no real controversy as to the legality of some action.
For example, "no peanut products" is not illegal, but "no peanuts" is, because no one's business is to make a peanut allergy policy (there are no legal differences between legal and illegal "no peanuts" policies). Thus, an "illegal" policy is a policy that is not legally enforced (for example, a policy that does not require a health food store to have a peanut allergy policy), whereas a "legal" policy is an enforcement policy, e.g., requiring a health food store to have a peanut allergy policy to avoid violating the law.
To answer the first question, "I think that it is worth $144,000.00" is a legal question because it does not specifically ask whether peanut allergies are worth an extra $144,000. Thus, the question is not exactly the same as the question "How much would the additional value of a $144,000.00 flight be?" The question is, instead, "Would you do the extra money to take on the risk of a peanut allergy?" This gives it a different and better answer than the answer "No." For example, "No" would be the answer for the question "How much would the additional value of a $144,000.00 flight be?" because the answer would be "No." However, if someone were to state "Yes", there would be a different answer, "Why not?", which would answer the question "How much would the additional value of a $144,000.00 flight be?" and not the question "Would you do the extra money to take on the risk of a peanut allergy?"
The second question is also a legal question. The reason this question is a legal question and not a factual question is that it does not attempt to answer whether or not something is legal. It is, instead, a question of whether or not a policy is legal. This question is quite different from the question "Would you pay an extra $144,000.00 to take on the risk of a peanut allergy?" Again, the answer to the first question is "Yes". The question "Are there legal ways to avoid a peanut allergy?" is a factual question. The answer is "Yes" even if there is no legal way to avoid a peanut allergy.

I'm willing to bet a lot of you are going to be very disappointed that the aircraft you're flying today, and the aircraft you're flying today, and the aircraft you're flying today, and the aircraft we took a look at the other night, are made by the same airline.

As a former flight attendant I know that I can't buy flight tickets from a particular airline, as they require a large deposit on the ticket before they can make you an airline reservation.

How about I can't buy a ticket from a particular airline because I don't have a credit card.

I am willing to bet a lot of you are going to be very disappointed that you don't have the same airline as the airline that owns the aircraft you're flying today.

When I was in the airline industry, I can count on two hands the number of times I've had to use a credit card to make an airline reservation.
