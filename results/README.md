dataset, and `both` is the merged dataset. The `[experiment]` part indicates
whether this experiment had as goal binary (verifiable/unverifiable) or
multi-class (non-argument, unverifiable, verifiable experiential, verifiable
non-experiential) classification. The [raw](raw/) folder contains some raw
output for the GPT-neo experiments.
