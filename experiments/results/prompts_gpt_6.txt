Comment: is the Terror implies an ideology as a motivation, rather than senseless killing for the sake of attention or being mentally ill.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism

Examples of terrorist mass shooters:

-Dylan Roof (shot up a black church because of his racist ideology)

-Omar Mateen (shot up a gay nightclub because of his ideology)

-Anders Behring Breivik (shot up a camp because of his ideology)

Examples of mass shooters that shouldn't be considered terrorists since their motivation was not from their ideology:

-The Columbine shooters (shot up their school because they wanted attention + wanted revenge on classmates)

-The movie theater shooter (shot up a theater because he wanted attention)

-Sandy Hook shooter (shot up a school because of his mental illness + wanting attention)

-Dallas Tower shooter (shot from a tower because of a brain tumor)

If they are *white* and are committing violence because of their ideology, they are terrorists. (Verifiability: Unverifiable)
