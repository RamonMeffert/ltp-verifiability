5506,as there is not enough staff to investigate individual banks on every corner with a different system in each one.,ms,219,9,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5507,Without a system like this investigating the banks will remain impossible,ms,219,10,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5508,and the problems will change instead of improve as new rules are implemented.,ms,219,11,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5509,I know this has nothing to do with the subject at hand.,ms,219,12,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5510,"But, I wish that the Cornell University Law School would get involved and figure out why the Supreme Court won't shut down MERS as it is a national problem and the courts are ruling differently in each state, making solving the banking problems worse.",ms,219,13,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5511,Maybe Cornell can change banking like the students changed Egypt! :-,ms,219,14,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5512,Not only do they claim that they have no affiliation with the originator and that they only purchased the servicing rights.,ms,222,0,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5513,After the borrower from frustration gives up and enters into default the servicer just calls themselves a debt collector.,ms,222,1,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5514,The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act does seem to provide added protection for borrowers.,ms,233,0,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5515,But I'm concerned when the servicer becomes a debt collector.,ms,233,1,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5516,At the time I wasn't in default my servicer already classed itself as a debt collector. As shown in this video.,ms,233,2,Regulation Room,verifiable,True
5517,By becoming a debt collector doesn't this allow the servicer to decide which and at what time the laws are applicable to them.,ms,233,3,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5518,The servicer stated over the phone that it was their policy to deny online access and not provide statements to anyone with a bankruptcy discharge unless the loan is reaffirmed.,ms,236,0,Regulation Room,verifiable,True
5519,I just recieved a response to my direct complaint to the servicer.,ms,236,1,Regulation Room,verifiable,True

5522,"If you have any questions please contact our bankruptcy department""",ms,236,4,Regulation Room,verifiable,True
5523,As you can see they are trying to use the statements as leverage to obtain a reaffirmation.,ms,236,5,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5524,I'd go so far as to call it blackmail.,ms,236,6,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5525,"They IMPLY that it is because of bankruptcy laws, and that is what they have TOLD others on the complaint blogs.",ms,236,7,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5526,"But because I have proven it is not a violation against the bankruptcy code,",ms,236,8,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5527,then this is simply a mean-spirited internal policy the servicer uses to abuse those who have gone through bankruptcy.,ms,236,9,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5528,Here is your opportunity to stand up for the borrower and make the servicer rescind it's abusive policy.,ms,236,10,Regulation Room,unverifiable,

5548,They allow for shoddy service and harmful practices.,ms,244,1,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5549,For 30 months I used a coupon book to pay my mortgage with BoA.,ms,244,2,Regulation Room,verifiable,True
5550,"Consequently, I could not see how my payments were allocated and how the principal was affected.",ms,244,3,Regulation Room,verifiable,True
5551,"My new servicer, by contrast, sends a monthly statement that details payment allocation and principal balance as of previous statement.",ms,244,4,Regulation Room,verifiable,True
5552,"To compare allocations between old and new servicer, I requested a payment history  from the old servicer.",ms,244,5,Regulation Room,verifiable,True
5553,"Lo and behold, I discovered that BoA, did not account for $3700and of my payment amounts over the 30-month preiod.",ms,244,6,Regulation Room,verifiable,True

5559,* For most small to mid-size lenders the actual statements are outsourced to a third party due to the cost of creating something in house.,ms,245,0,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5560,Therefore the ability to change the format of a statement is not only limited but very expensive.,ms,245,1,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5561,In a time of ever shrinking margins  this is a cost that just cannot be easily absorbed.,ms,245,2,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5562,* If the CFPB is going to require changes to a statement they should create a safe harbor format to shield FI's from being sued by lawyers looking to make money and not protect consumers.,ms,245,3,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5563,As someone who has been in the industry for well over a quarter I can give some insight here.,ms,246,0,Regulation Room,verifiable,True
5564,For a small to midsize lender the mortgages will often be stored on a system that is not connected in real time to your core processing system.,ms,246,1,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5565,This would prevent someone from being able to view their mortgage on their home banking page.,ms,246,2,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5566,It's not meant to be secretive,ms,246,3,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5567,but it is just a fact that different computer systems often do not communicate with each other.,ms,246,4,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5568,I am against having oral and written requests being treated equally.,ms,246,5,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5569,"Written requests have, by their nature, a more formal stature and create a paper trail.",ms,246,6,Regulation Room,unverifiable,

5582,If PMI is mandatory then it should be listed and broken down on the statement that we are discussing.,ms,257,4,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5583,Banks need to be removed from insurance where it appears they commit massive fraud so banks will  return to focusing on loaning money.,ms,257,5,Regulation Room,unverifiable,

5586,Structure and PMI insurance is considered part of the monthly house payment just like interest and principle.,ms,257,8,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5587,This keeps what is mandatory to secure a loan to a minimum so homes will not be lost due to over priced insurance any longer.,ms,257,9,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5588,Nobody should loose their home because they are paying for optional items either.,ms,257,10,Regulation Room,unverifiable,

5590,"If the homeowner wants insurance for theft, personal injury or house content then this is handled directly between the homeowner and the insurance company if they can afford it",ms,257,12,Regulation Room,unverifiable,

5592,"Basically moderator, separating minimum priced mandatory bank insurance from optional insurance is crucial and could make the difference from making a house payment or not.",ms,257,14,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
5593,Mandatory insurance should be in the name of the bank and homeowner.,ms,257,15,Regulation Room,unverifiable,
