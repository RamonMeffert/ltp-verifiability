For example, let's have one club where people are crazy about Marvel, and one that's crazy about DC. People don't want to have their interests shit on for a long period of time.

Safe spaces applied to an entire place, especially those forced upon people, really do have good intentions. They want students to feel accepted, even when those abrasive people are barricading or shushing.

There aren't really that many flat-earth safe spaces to speak of.

However, having some 'safe space' - some place where you can go to relax, be among people like you who aren't coming at you with arguments or insults or even general stuff that puts you out of sorts - is downright human. People need time to sort things out, to sit down and relax without being on-edge at having to deal with this or that jarring visual or argument or anything else.

This isn't to say universities or any other place is doing a good job of implementing these safe spaces. I'd say most of them suck.

t3_4xsg8k,d6i2hvz,Now that's not to say that there can't be problems.,"The thing is, with respect to some issues, there's just not a lot of value in the ""challenges"" because they're very rarely novel or thought-provoking. Just the same old worthless crap over and over and over again. 

Example. I'm bisexual, and I've been told probably a couple hundred times that I'm either (1) straight and want to be special, or (2) gay and just haven't *really* come out yet. Like clockwork, if I talk about my sexuality, there it is. It's not *challenging*, just an annoying waste of my time. Seeking out a space where I can have a conversation about bi erasure or something without having to spend 20 minutes trying to convince people (and never, not once, succeeding) that I'm not *lying* about my sexuality is not causing some great poverty of honest discourse. 

And that's just a very benign example. There are others in which the stakes are far higher. I'm sure you can imagine. 

Now that's not to say that there can't be problems. I agree that the kind of insulation safe spaces if taken to extremes can create from the world at large can lead to a kind of culture shock upon exiting.

Management is a great example. Recruiters are looking for your employment history and evidence of what you've done in practice. The degree is a tick in the box to ensure a minimum standard of education level, hence why you'll see so many ads that say ""degree education required"" but doesn't specify exactly which subject it has to be in.

And we love those tasks not because there is anything special about it, but because we are really good at it, so we feel good about ourselves when we excel in those tasks.

So we attribute this to this warm fuzzy notion that we ""like"" or ""love"" something, or that it is our ""passion"".

But yes, if there is nothing we are really good at, then the next course of action should be what you proposed.",5017,UnVerif,,,1,5017,2022-05-03T13:37:44.734866Z,2022-05-03T13:37:44.734909Z,5.893

I may have made a bit less, but i don't need to spend anything as a result so it's not such a big difference. Not only that, but i work side jobs in my field on my spare time. Since i love my job, it makes me even happier to go out and work, while making even more money. So in the end, I'm being paid to have fun on my time off that i spend with friends. 

Not to mention the fact that i love my job means im always looking for new ways to improve my work, always willing and eager to learn. It makes me very valuable to employers.

I spent lots of time learning music theory, exploring different forms of performing arts, and overall enjoying myself. I've taken instrumental music (although that is where it started), dance, theater, and will be also doing choir. Meanwhile, I've taken up composition and history research projects that have expanded my skills as a musician.

While a computer engineering degree would definitely pay out better and still be very compatible with me, I find myself also finding a very heavy preference to composition and conducting at the moment. As much as it pays out less for no different interest value, I find that there is a sentimental value with my experience as a musician. My teachers are basically parents to me, and have driven me way farther than I have ever expected (metaphorically and literally). It's another perspective that I find really interesting and unique.",5055,UnVerif,,,1,5055,2022-05-03T13:58:12.043086Z,2022-05-03T13:58:12.043120Z,5.824

t3_4ph4lk,d4lpk2n,I see several problems with this line of thinking.,"I see several problems with this line of thinking.

First there is informational asymmetry.  What is reported as jobs that are in high in demand and therefore high in earnings yield, often has a delay from what is actually true on the ground. Or worse the actual numbers maybe intentionally suppressed.  As a result, in some fields there is a surplus in the labor supply and as a result pay and opportunities are lower than assumed.

Next, if you are looking to have a long term career in a given field, you are going to have a hard time being competitive against those who have 1) talent in the field and 2) proclivity toward the field.  The first part is actually less important (and potentially detrimental to some, for reasons I wont go into here), the second part is really important. Ones willingness to work harder in developing skills and talent in a given field is related to ones interest in working in that field. As a result promotions and better positions will be harder to achieve while burn-out in the field will be greater, if you don't have a proclivity.

Finally, given that labor markets are likely going to be increasingly unpredictable, if you are going the university choosing to include among your majors something that lends itself to making you adaptable or available to many markets is as important as specialized skills that may be in demand.

TLDR:

1)What appears to be needed now, may not be now or may not be when you finish.

Like totally one should choose a course that they like just in order to achieve the highest results they can so to do the best for themselves. However there is most definitely an argument to be made for people choosing realistic subjects and to think long and hard and be realistic about their job opportunities, purely just because it is better to always be thinking ahead. University education is all about doing what is best for you, and making yourself into a smarter, more efficient and hire-able individual employment prospects and ultimately to make more money. There is no point going into ANY course without already knowing exactly what you want to do and where you want to go when you are done. Anybody else is just kidding themselves.

t3_70h6gb,dn35xj5,"You might invent a way to do something, but you do not invent that something is impossible.","I would argue that words aren't really discovered *or* invented - they are established, because they're only useful as tools by convention.

While math uses conventions, because math terms and such are conveyed through language, the tools and techniques associated with math are valuable independent of adoption of others - so they aren't established like language tools are.

That still leaves discovery or invention, though. To dig down into that, let's reframe the concepts: When you do math on things, are you exploring possibilities, or are you attempting to develop a tool?

You're wright and rong at the same time (get it?  Wright?  Rong?  No?  OK, fine, be that way).

Mathematical *concepts* were indeed invented.  But actual mathematics isn't the concepts; it's the relationships between them.  For example, you have to invent a lot of concepts to even be able to say 2 + 3, but however you get to those concepts, however you imagine sets of constant cardinality to be, whether numbers count things or measure things or weigh things or whatever you imagine, you will *always* get 5.  Sure, the *symbols* and the *names* were invented, but there is simply no universe in which 2 + 3 is anything other than 5.  Even the operation of addition may be invented in some other way, but for anything that corresponds isomorphically to *our* addition, 2 + 3 = 5.

As time goes by we *invent* new mathematical concepts and we *discover* their relationships.  Sure, sometimes we decide -- why not? -- that it would be just ducky if a particular invented concept satisfied particular relationships, so we invent that concept in that way and everyone's happy... but then we discover new relationships about that concept, don't we?

t3_70h6gb,dn336z2,The debate of whether or not [math is invented or discovered](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derek-abbott/is-mathematics-invented-o_b_3895622.html) is not a new one.,"The debate of whether or not [math is invented or discovered](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/derek-abbott/is-mathematics-invented-o_b_3895622.html) is not a new one. There are three main schools of thoughts on this. Platonist (discovered), Non-platonis (invented), Neutralists (who cares?). I personally identify with a small subset of neutralists in the sense that I do not believe the debate is even framed properly and going with either discovered or invented are both equally silly. While I believe in the validity of the question, and thereby, isolating me from the majority of the neutralist camp, I do believe the frame of this topic is the reason why there can be no satisfactory answer. Math, above all of its practical implementation, is an abstract ideology at its core. Much like love, time, emotions.

Some people become poor by risking everything. Are they pieces of shit? What makes the people who ended up successful any more special? 

&gt;They shouldn't have to give away half of their household income. Yes, half.

So I see from other comments that you do actually understand how marginal tax rates work so this statement is misleading. Even if the top marginal tax rate was 50%, you would have to make about $10 million per year before your income was effectively halved. People at that level probably make much of their money from capital gains which is taxed differently. Not to mention all the write-offs and loopholes they benefit from.

&gt;Asking for Bernie's student debt forgiveness is a short-sighted, quick fix that you want because you're feeling the pressure of student loans on your bank account. Again, don't be selfish.

He's not advocating forgiveness of student loans across the board. From what I can find it seems that he may be saying that loan forgiveness might be appropriate in some rare cases. More importantly his  plan is to reduce interest rates on student loans and to make the *first two years of community college* free. 

&gt;But if my degree was included with my parent's taxes, the demand for my skills would be lower.

Are you aware of the strong correlation of wealth across generations?  How rich your parents are is a strong predictor of how rich you'll be.  That's definitely not ""risk"". Same with parents wealth correlating with college graduation etc.

Relatedly, most people are never in a position to even reasonably take that kind of risk. You can if your parents are supporting you.  But if you're working long hours to help the family pay the bills starting on your 16th birthday, it's not a reasonable option.  That has little to do with hard work.  It's an accident of birth.  

Also, the types of jobs which pay YUGE amounts aren't always correlated with providing the most gain to society.  Finance is important but a lot of people also make tons of money and don't help society much.  The way the government and tax system and all that are set up are part of why this has happened, and even if it weren't we can reasonably decide as a society to change this.

Most of the very rich were born that way and there are whole industries designed to keep them that way. People who have recently become upper class generally have the deck stacked in their favor and didn't have that far to climb to make it to that upper echelon. 

The fact of the matter is there is far less social mobility, that is ; ability to improve ones circumstances, in America than in other parts of the world. Poverty has become a trap, not because people are lazy and refuse to work, but because work, especially labor, is no longer paid enough to secure a comfortable life.

t3_44w1wn,czua10q,A huge problem in America right now is wealth disparity.,"A huge problem in America right now is wealth disparity. Lowering the financial burden of college doesn't lessen the the amount of knowledge learned or how rigorous an achievement is. It simply allows smart, hardworking people who otherwise couldn't not afford higher education to get educated in a field of their choosing. If anything, increasing the amount of people who are able to go to college would increase competion. This would cause getting into a good program to be more impressive than otherwise.

Likewise, most Bernie Sanders' supporters don't want everyone to make the same wage. Innovators, business owners and employees that have large stress/workload demands will still get paid significantly more than the unskilled worker. However, by narrowing this gap you open the options for many hardworking people to succeed. That person who works two jobs to stay afloat and cant afford the money nor time to get a degree in their passion might be able to quit one job to go back to school part time. Those families who weren't fortunate enough to come from a rich past wont have to worry as much about if they can pay their rent or if they can give their children a childhood they think they deserve. Plus they would be able to spend more money which would be reinvested in the economy.

I think the reason that the younger generation speaks the loudest in a need for change is because they are firsthand experiencing these struggles that their parents and especially their grandparents never had to contend with on this scale.

What you think of as a disability that ruins one's live is simply a condition you see in passing.  You probably think they won't ever have some semblance of happiness, but that couldn't be further from the truth.  It's education and involvement, just like with ""normal"" kids.

And from the article, ""These are people who, despite their disabilities, have abilities, [...]""

People with disabilities can continue their lives to be completely happy, and can even hold jobs and help out in many ways.  It's also useful to blend populations of ""normal"" kids and those who are disabled, as both can learn from each other.

One thing I don't get is why you think their lives are forfeit?  Because you did the same thing everyone's done, including myself, and thought ""Man, I'd rather not live than live like that""?

So a) you have no experience with children or maybe people that are disabled and b) you don't think that's relevant, even though your post is about pointing out all the people that make a choice to the contrary.  I kind of feel like you do have to know what you're talking about before you raise any questions like these.

t3_61gkuk,dfgazp1,We don't euthanize pedophiles.,"We don't euthanize pedophiles. Even after they act upon their urges and rape children, we don't euthanize pedophiles. Until they start killing their victims, all we do is lock them up for a period of time. Even if they do murder their victims, some of us will be arguing how euthanizing murdering pedophiles (i.e. the death penalty) is morally reprehensible and so much better to have society pay for their upkeep for the rest of their lives.

An article on the Harvard School of Medicine websites states that ""researchers have found no effective treatment.

He basically has the intelligence and reasoning of a ten or twelve year old kid, though he is in his fifties now. Think 'Forest Gump.' Currently he has taken up leatherworking and seems to like that, but not as much as he likes to play videogames. It took me playing WoW for a year to try raiding. He jumped in right away because he is basically fearless, and not afraid of failure. He laughs when people call him retarded, and says, ""Well I am!"" He put up with so much shit in high school that insults lost all meaning.

I know he is a rare exception, but I love him very much and am proud of him every day. He loves sarcasm and thinks I am the funniest person alive. He's a pretty cool cat.

""Parents allowing completely disabled children to live should be condemned (in some way).""
