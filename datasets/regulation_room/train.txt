u,DOT's objective in setting this rule should be to ELIMINATE all bumping, not merely achieve some  reduction.#apr.522.0
u,Regardless of how many caveats an airline might state in its contract terms, passengers neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat.#apr.522.1
u,Bumping is a purely economic device that treats passengers as economic units devoid of humanity, like so many other aspects of airline behavior.#apr.522.2
u,From that objective, it follows that there should be NO cap on compensation and that the financial penalty to the airline should be strong enough to prevent bumping, not just keep it at some arbitrarily "acceptable" level.#apr.522.3
u,The 100% of the total ticket price for expected arrival within 2 hours later is reasonable.#apr.522.4
u,Compensation for a longer delay should be the GREATER of 200% of the total ticket cost or the passenger's demonstrable out-of-pocket costs resulting from the delay  including any higher priced air ticket from the same or another carrier at the same class, and lodging, meals and incidentals at average prevailing prices in that metro area, and  with the obligation on the passenger to minimize those costs by arranging, with good faith help from the airline, an alternate flight or other means to get him or her to the destination as soon as reasonably practical.#apr.522.5
u,I strongly support cash compensation for bumping passengers with zero-price tickets, e.g., those from frequent-flier programs.#apr.523.0
u,But to assure adequate compensation and prevent airlines gaming such a requirement, compensation should be at the average  ticket price for that service class on that flight.#apr.523.1
u,DOT's proposed rule using the lowest fare ticket would encourage airlines to bump those with zero-price tickets first,#apr.523.2
u,since that cost would be lowest.#apr.523.3
u,As long as they continue to offer tickets for miles, airlines should not be encouraged to treat passengers using those tickets as second-class when it comes to bumping.#apr.523.4
u,The growing scarcity of actual seats for miles -- something that cries out for regulatory intervention -- is bad enough.#apr.523.5
u,The proposals are certainly reasonable and should also be extended to include on-line booking services#apr.32.0
u,since that could be a potential loophole for the airlines not to comply.#apr.32.1
u,There is another growing problem that needs to be addressed, limitation on in-flight sales and solicitation.#apr.33.0
u,One US carrier has mastered this art.#apr.33.1
u,Flight attendants are on the intercom from take-off to landing selling everything from MasterCards to sandwiches.#apr.33.2
e,I boarded USA in Miami in March#apr.33.3
e,and it was the coldest airplance I've ever seen.#apr.33.4
e,Moments later when the lady across the aisle asked for a blanket for her and her young child she was told they had no complimentary ones but could sell her two!#apr.33.5
e,There is NO question in my mind the reason the plane was so cold was to generate blanket sales.#apr.33.6
u,This is just wrong.#apr.33.7
u,What many people who are supporting a ban are forgetting  is if someone has such a severe peanut allergy that a reaction occurs when breathing or touching something else that has been contaminated , then *all* aircrafts that have ever had peanuts aboard are contaminated.#apr.613.0
n,Banning future peanuts doesn't change that cross-contamination is already in place and it's already a life-threatening environment.#apr.613.1
u,Not feasible.#apr.613.2
e,I, too, suffer from a life-threatening food allergy;#apr.613.3
u,but I do not expect the world to change for me.#apr.613.4
e,I adjust to the world;#apr.613.5
e,if I think there's a chance that I will be exposed to my food "poison, I don't go there.#apr.613.6
u,It's inconvenient and sometimes a hardship for me,#apr.613.7
e,but I'm the one with the allergy.#apr.613.8
u,Unfortunately, there are no guarantees in this world.#apr.613.9
u,Probably.#apr.613.10
u,The problem is that banning peanuts alone won't make life on a plane safer;#apr.613.11
u,it'll only be as safe as fellow passengers or airline staff taking precautions for the risk#apr.613.12
u,and, frankly, those who don't have or know anyone who has life-threatening allergies have no idea how easily cross-contamination can occur.#apr.613.13
e,As someone with such an allergy,#apr.613.14
u,there's no way I would place my trust for my life on strangers to take precautions for my allergy.#apr.613.15
u,Banning isn't a real solution; finding a cure is.#apr.613.16
u,It is unfortunate that the airlines have forced the government to step and and set limits by holding passengers hostage on the tarmac and treating them like items to be shipped and not people.#apr.1201.0
u,While schedules must be met -#apr.1201.1
u,EVERYONE is inconvenienced by flight delays, including the airline, the travelers and the airport.#apr.1201.2
u,Consideration is what is needed here,#apr.1201.3
u,and the airlines have proven that they cannot be considerate to the travelers without a rule.#apr.1201.4
u,Consequently, I believe a federal limit is necessary,#apr.1201.5
u,however I believe there are multiple factors that should be considered.#apr.1201.6
u,For instance, if a plane with 100 people on it has only 2 operating bathrooms, perhaps the timeframe should be shorter than a plane with more bathrooms in operation.#apr.1201.7
u,Further, I would think the delay for a smaller plane that provides passengers with so little headroom that they cannot stand up without bending their heads  should be less than 3 hours.#apr.1201.8
u,The facilities on the plane could also be a factor .#apr.1201.9
u,I believe that if the airport is closed  and the bathrooms on the plane are sufficient to satisfy the needs of the travelers, there is no reason to let travelers off the plane if the plane is waiting at the gate.#apr.1201.10
u,However, if the airport is open and the airline does not intend to provide travelers with food, it is appropriate for the airline to let travelers off the plane so they can get food if the wait is long.#apr.1201.11
u,I see the reason for letting travelers deplane as being to allow them to obtain what they need and cannot get if they are held on the plane.#apr.1201.12
u,If international passengers are allowed to disembark, but are unable to access bathrooms or shops to obtain food or reading material, I don't see that as a reasonable accommodation.#apr.1201.13
n,The only reason the airlines do not want to publish their plans in their respective contracts of carriage is because people may attempt to sue them if they fail to comply with those plans.#apr.1201.14
u,Not that I believe people should sue at the drop of a hat,#apr.1201.15
u,but I do believe the travelers should have that as an option if the airline acts in an egregious manner.#apr.1201.16
u,Thus, I believe airlines should be required to include their plans in their contracts of carriage.#apr.1201.17
u,I believe that airports should have tarmac contingency plans.#apr.1201.18
u,Perhaps if both the airlines and the airports were required to have plans, the back and forth would lead to better coordination.#apr.1201.19
u,Throughout all, I believe the airlines should inform their travelers about the situation regularly.#apr.1201.20
u,One reason for traveler angst in these situations is due to the lack of information.#apr.1201.21
u,Setting traveler expectations is good.#apr.1201.22
u,However, airlines also must realize that sometimes the best decision is to let the travelers get off the plane and make other travel arrangements.#apr.1201.23
u,I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that airlines should be required to provide travelers with a full-fare" price.#apr.1211.0
u,This would allow travelers to compare prices between carriers and make better decisions.#apr.1211.1
u,A good alternative would be to allow an individual to choose what options they will use  and provide an all-in price that includes those options .#apr.1211.2
u,This would allow travelers to determine what the "all-in" price includes, but would still allow the traveler to compare apples to apples when determining which airline to travel with.#apr.1211.3
u,ALL carriers that operate in the US should be required to display all-in fares for all flights that either begin or end in the US.#apr.1211.4
u,One result I could see here would be that an airline may allow one checked bag, but the size of the bag may be smaller for some carriers than others - and the charge for oversized bags may be more.#apr.1211.5
u,Oversized bags may be something one doesn't think about until one gets to the airport and then finds out the bag is too big.#apr.1211.6
u,Consequently, it might be good for a more prominent display of requirements on the traveler - e.g., bag size and weight.#apr.1211.7
u,As to "code share" price display - as a traveler, I want to know what I am paying and what the restrictions on me would be.#apr.1211.8
u,If there is no cost difference for me to fly on an airline the airline I have contracted with has sub-contracted with to fly me somewhere, I am OK knowing only the all-in price.#apr.1211.9
u,I think, however, that it is important for me, the traveler, to know if the subcontractor has more restrictive luggage requirements that could cause me to need to pay additional fees.#apr.1211.10
u,I believe people want to know about the fees and restrictions when they arrange for travel.#apr.1211.11
u,I'm not sure it is necessary to advertise changes in fees or restrictions.#apr.1211.12
u,Instead, I believe the fees or restrictions should not change for a passenger that has bought his or her ticket.#apr.1211.13
n,The contract between the airline and traveler is set when the ticket is purchased#apr.1211.14
u,and unilateral changes to fees that affect the traveler should not be allowed.#apr.1211.15
u,If that contract allows the airline to change restrictions , the airline should be required to inform affected passengers that have already purchased tickets.#apr.1211.16
u,I think it is terrific that DOT is, based on its experience with customer service plans, setting minimum requirements.#apr.1215.0
u,All of the requirements listed seem reasonable.#apr.1215.1
u,I would not want to fly with an airline that did not do those things.#apr.1215.2
u,With respect to the listed additional standards, I think it is important to note that if a bag is not delivered within 2 hours after the passenger landed on the first leg of a round-trip flight - it could be problematic.#apr.1215.3
u,Whereas if it were delivered that late on the second leg of a round trip and the carrier later delivers it to the traveler's home it may not be such a big deal.#apr.1215.4
u,Similarly, if the round-trip flight is over a long weekend, it is more important for the bag to catch up with the traveler quickly,#apr.1215.5
u,but if the round-trip is over a two week period in one place and the airline delivers the bag to the traveler within a day it may not be as big a deal.#apr.1215.6
u,Refunds for bag fees on lost bags seems appropriate.#apr.1215.7
u,As to fees and taxes, I believe refunds should include any fees and taxes the carrier has not otherwise been required to pay to someone else.#apr.1215.8
u,I also believe carriers should reimburse travelers for lost bags.#apr.1215.9
u,If the carrier fails to deliver a bag on-time, that also should be reimbursed -#apr.1215.10
u,however I believe the definition of "on time" could be flexible.#apr.1215.11
u,It is important to carriers to publish on-time performance.#apr.1218.0
u,This is an important statistic used by some travelers to make choices about the carriers they wish to fly with.#apr.1218.1
u,Also, the requirement to publish these statistics makes the carriers pay more attention to their achievements both individually and as compared to other carriers.#apr.1218.2
e,I have a peanut allergy and do not fly on airplanes very often.#apr.678.0
e,However, my husband and I took a trip that required flying for travel#apr.678.1
u,and I was very worried about the peanuts.#apr.678.2
e,I took over-the-counter medicine to prevent a reaction and was very careful during the trip.#apr.678.3
u,I can be as careful as I need to be,#apr.678.4
n,but I can't help what the people around me eat.#apr.678.5
u,I think that the two best ideas are banning nuts  from all flights, or having nut-free flights available .#apr.678.6
u,When discussing an epinephrine auto-injector, I feel there should be one on the plane as part of the medical equipment, but should only be used in an emergency situation.#apr.678.7
e,My doctor to me that if I use the Epi Pen, I have a few minutes to get to a hospital so they can regulate the epinephrine that's just been injected into my body.#apr.678.8
e,This advice has caused me not to use the Epi Pen when I know that I can't get to a hospital in a short amount of time.#apr.678.9
u,To me foods items, like a nut crusted chicken and rice dish will not bother me the way peanuts will.#apr.678.10
n,Peanut butter provides the same reaction,#apr.678.11
n,so peanut butter crackers would be out" with a nut-free ban.#apr.678.12
n,Products containing peanut oil are a different matter.#apr.678.13
e,My doctor explained that the protein that I'm allergic to is broken down in the "oil" form,#apr.678.14
u,so foods cooked in peanut oil  do not bother me.#apr.678.15
u,I think there should be no caps on amount airlines have to pay.#apr.1077.0
u,I agree with the proposed required customer service rules.#apr.1079.0
u,Full Prices should be fully disclosed up front,#apr.1080.0
u,and the lowest price available should be disclosed.#apr.1080.1
u,prices should not be increased after purchase.#apr.1080.2
u,DOT should extend the tarmac delay rules to all flights in the US#apr.1081.0
e,On a recent trip from Wa state to Michigan, every single flight  was late by at least a half hour, resulting in missed connections both ways.#apr.855.0
u,When the airport is more than two hours away, notifying passengers of a potential half hour delay won't significantly change whether they head for the airport or not.#apr.855.1
u,However, in retrospect, I would have LOVED to know the following when booking flights: 1 airline's yearly on time percentage; 2 airline's passenger satisfaction rating.#apr.855.2
u,Personally, if I'm going to be treated like cattle, I'd just as soon be happy cattle.#apr.855.3
u,Air travel has turned into such a frustrating exercise  that we look for reasons not to go air.#apr.855.4
u,Frankly, if I have to live with such delays, I'd just as soon do it on a train. THEY are still fun, despite their delays.#apr.855.5
u,anything else whose risks of fatal reaction outweigh the mere convenience of the ignorant, I hope.#apr.254.0
u,ricport, everyone is responsible for themselves AND their effects on others.#apr.257.0
u,Airlines are NOT public spaces. If airlines ban peanuts, MANY passengers WILL bring their own peanuts on board ... as airlines cannot stop people from bringing their own snacks.#apr.677.0
u,I am sympathetic to people with allergies,#apr.677.1
u,but people with allergies need to be prepared with their medicine and then need to stop trying to impose their need on the 99% of the healthy  population.#apr.677.2
u,* 30 minutes is too long;#apr.945.0
n,you say the majority leave within 14 minutes#apr.945.1
u,so set the beginning info as 15 minutes with 30 minute updates unless a resolution is known sooner.#apr.945.2
u,* Specify notification be by all methods available at the airport involved, including ticket agents, with the customer additionally specifying how they are to be notified at home; email, phone, FAX.#apr.945.3
u,* All commercial flights should be included.#apr.945.4
u,* Include the primary reason: bad weather-locally; bad weather-enroute; bad weather at destination; etc.#apr.945.5
u,Don't forget the obvious reasons they don't do better; no enlightened effective regulation; executive compensation; union rules; airport and FAA inefficiencies; monopoly status ; ultimately the bottom line .#apr.946.0
u,Let's look at this logically:#apr.947.0
n,The airline knows when they sell a ticket;#apr.947.1
n,they know when they have sold the full number.#apr.947.2
u,Those passengers should be guaranteed a seat; NO EXCUSES.#apr.947.3
u,Any subsequent tickets sold should be sold as STANDBY with a ranking 1-n, first come; first served!#apr.947.4
u,Problem solved.#apr.947.5
u,If anyone wants to volunteer; use the approach below.#apr.947.6
u,IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE SIMPLE APPROACH!#apr.947.7
u,* First ask for volunteers to receive the next available comparable or better seat on the airline or any other airline, the airline agents to make the arrangements and pay for the seat directly, the passenger to be reimbursed in cash or credit card for their anticipated out of pocket costs due to the delay and their total out of pocket flight costs, tickets, baggage checks, any other fees.#apr.947.8
u,If points were used they would be reinstated with new expiration dates.#apr.947.9
u,*  Do a lottery, no limits, with at least  the results in 1., above, cash or credit cards only;#apr.947.10
u,NO VOUCHERS,#apr.947.11
u,they're almost impossible to use.#apr.947.12
u,* If they still bump someone the sky should be the limit, the results to be appropriate booking plus at least double  the payout in 2., above.#apr.947.13
u,Of course airline lawyers would attempt to make it five pages of weasel words.#apr.947.14
u,Disclosure, disclosure, disclosure!#apr.949.0
u,Not just the ticket price but also the Agent's fee,#apr.952.0
u,which sometimes is considerable.#apr.952.1
u,And Yes! they should not be able to raise the quoted price.#apr.952.2
u,It makes no sense and is misleading to quote a one way price if I have to buy a roundtrip ticket.#apr.954.0
u,If the itemization is Boston to Bombay fare, then various fees, then Bombay to Boston fare and various fees, it is still misleading unless it is specifically preceded by "Round Trip Required"#apr.954.1
u,If I just want to go from Boston to Bombay and stay there or go  somewhere else, I shouldn't buy this ticket and I should know it "up front".#apr.954.2
u,This whole process of additional regulation is brought about because of lack of disclosure by airlines and agents when they unbundle services and initiate obscene fees for them so that we buy tickets and still don't have a deal because we may still be hit by additional fees at checkin.#apr.955.0
u,A DEAL SHOULD BE A DEAL!#apr.955.1
u,Of course not.#apr.955.2
u,I think we should always be talking about airlines, travel agents, and other resellers.#apr.957.0
u,I think the smaller typeface is a bad idea.#apr.957.1
u,Small type is always used for something the purveyor has to say but doesn't want us to be able to read, and we usually can't.#apr.957.2
u,No!  Retroactive pricing is essentially fraud and violates the contract made when money changes hands.#apr.958.0
u,I would favor a rule that disallowed even having a round trip requirement for prices.#apr.958.1
u,If an airline wants to give a credit for roundtrip like stores give case discounts on groceries or such, and listed it as a separate credit in their advertising and on their ticket that might work.#apr.958.2
u,Fares from Boston to New York might vary by time of day and by day of the week#apr.958.3
u,but they should never be based on Round Trip Required.#apr.958.4
u,This is the same as bumping and should be compensated  as such.#apr.959.0
u,See my comments under that category.#apr.959.1
u,It is not just the five hours,#apr.959.2
u,though that is bad enough;#apr.959.3
u,it is all the other inconveniences, arriving late at night, having to cancel engagements, having to call a cab for a long ride vs bus transportation, and a myriad other inconveniences for which the airlines in their hubris currently accepts no responsibility.#apr.959.4
u,The price of fuel doesn't change while I am trying to book a flight.#apr.960.0
u,Maybe airlines should only be allowed to change prices once a week, or once a day, always at midnight, or something like that.#apr.960.1
u,It is extremely frustrating to try to buy a ticket and have availability and or or price change while you are pushing the "Buy" button.#apr.960.2
u,Since all these airlines are still split on what services call for fees and how much those services actually cost, they need to create a standard for every airline to use as a basis for quoting prices.#apr.495.0
u,Go back a few years to what was considered "standard", and have them quote on: - RT airfare- 1 checked bag- advance seat selection- beverage service- taxes and fees#apr.495.1
u,From there, passengers can unbundle as necessary or add things like premium seating and 2nd or 3rd checked bags .#apr.495.2
u,Rather than encourage airlines to hide all the extra fees, it would instead encourage them to promote their fees -- "You can save $XXX if you don't check a bag and don't care where you sit!"#apr.495.3
u,* Although perhaps an improvement over current procedures, this will only help a portion of peanut or nut allergic people, and mostly likely won't help severely allergic individuals.#apr.318.0
n,* Airborne peanut or nut proteins can cause anaphylactic reactions faster than surface-bound peanut or nut proteins;#apr.318.1
n,the recycled air in the plane exacerbates this problem.#apr.318.2
n,* Every surface could still be contaminated, even if you wipe down your seats; for example, touching any other arm rest, using lavatory doors, toilets, sinks, and surfaces right after someone else who was eating peanuts or nuts.#apr.318.3
u,* There would simply still be too many risks.#apr.318.4
u,* Again, better than current procedures, and better than a buffer zone, but still a problem.#apr.318.5
n,A peanut or nut allergic individual would likely be walking onto a plane that was not peanut or nut free 30 minutes prior;#apr.318.6
n,and although some cleaning of the cabins occurs between flights,#apr.318.7
n,many of the same issues mentioned above would still exist.#apr.318.8
u,* Most people don't understand and or or are not tolerant of peanut or nut allergy, purely out of lack of knowledge of its severity#apr.318.9
u,prior to having a son diagnosed with peanut or nut and soy allergies I didn't know what it entailed either;#apr.318.10
u,* This has the potential to single out the peanut or nut allergic "offender" .#apr.318.11
u,* The only viable solution to make air travel routinely safe for everyone.#apr.318.12
u,* Although there may still be risks of passengers violating the policy,#apr.318.13
n,this resolves all of the issues mentioned above.#apr.318.14
u,The surfaces of and air inside the plane would be safe,#apr.318.15
u,all travelers would know what to expect,#apr.318.16
u,no one would know who was or wasn't peanut or nut allergic.#apr.318.17
u,* Airlines have nothing to lose by instituting a full ban;#apr.318.18
u,they only have customers to gain.#apr.318.19
u,Like with any changes in air travel policy, if such a ban is universally instituted, everyone will have to accept it,#apr.318.20
u,and it will not prevent people from continuing to fly.#apr.318.21
u,However, what will happen is that a large and continuously growing part of the customer market that currently cannot or will not fly, will buy tickets knowing that air travel can be safe.#apr.318.22
u,* Bear in mind the severity of a situation where a peanut or nut allergic individual goes into anaphylactic shock mid-air.#apr.318.23
n,In some cases, Benadryl and an Epipen  will resolve the reaction for an amount of time.#apr.318.24
n,However, in many cases these measures merely buy you enough time to get to an emergency room, typically 10 to 15 minutes;#apr.318.25
u,which would not be possible when in mid-air.#apr.318.26
u,Therefore, while the first two policy options may reduce risk to a degree,#apr.318.27
u,they are not sufficient, assuming that the goal here is to make air travel safe for everyone.#apr.318.28
u,I don't think that flights of less than 60 should be covered:#apr.1244.0
u,in general passengers on these smaller aircraft get more personal service and it would be less cumbersome to deplane passengers if needed.#apr.1244.1
u,The 3-hour rule should apply to international carriers as well as US carriers.#apr.1244.2
u,Small hub and non hub airports should also be subject to the 3-hour limit for domestic flights.#apr.1244.3
u,Where a plane is at the gate and the aircraft door has not yet been closed, passengers should be permitted to deplane after, say, 1 hour.#apr.1244.4
u,In addition, passengers should be able to deplane if the plane has returned to the gate and the delay is over 1 hour.#apr.1244.5
e,In relation to deplaning delayed or diverted international passengers, I recall  facing exactly the same issue when traveling trans-Pacific and transiting Hawaii.#apr.1244.6
e,We were always able to deplane in Hawaii as long as we remained within a certain area of the airport.#apr.1244.7
e,At least we were able to stretch our legs and use the bathroom facilities in the airport.#apr.1244.8
u,I agree with DOT's proposals on clarifying bumping rules and adequately compensating those involuntarily bumped.#apr.1245.0
u,Passengers who are voluntarily or involutarily bumped should be advised by the gate agents on the cash or check or travel voucher option and the criteria for involuntary bumping prioritization.#apr.1245.1
u,On compensation, I think the actual ticket amount, plus a small premium to cover the unbundled aspects of the costs associated with the trip would suffice.#apr.1245.2
u,Given that these smaller aircraft service less popular routes , oversales should be prohibited,#apr.1245.3
u,but the airlines should allow a few passengers to be on "stand by" in the event of a no show.#apr.1245.4
u,Zero-fare tickets should be compensated by recrediting the passenger with the number of miles used for the journey, plus cash for minor overhead costs.#apr.1245.5
u,Before talking about something being too harsh for the airlines, we have to decide what to do about the fact the airlines were all against a passenger bill of right.#apr.190.0
u,If they didn't want something that would help it's customers, then customers should push for the harshest punishment possible.#apr.190.1
u,Charging extra for all checked bags ultimately causes passenger injuries.#apr.980.0
u,It's a safety issue.#apr.980.1
u,The proposed rule is wise and good and forbids a despicable practice, but misses the larger issue of passenger safety.#apr.980.2
u,Charging a fee for all checked baggage is the problem that you should focus on.#apr.980.3
u,Charging for all checked bags encourages travelers to overload the overhead bins with large, heavy bags.#apr.980.4
u,Passengers are not professional baggage handlers.#apr.980.5
u,Baggage handlers don't hoist bags they can barely lift over passengers' heads.#apr.980.6
n,Passengers do this or pay $20-$40 extra per bag.#apr.980.7
u,Passengers are not as fit as baggage handlers, are not trained at all, and often can not lift their bags into the crowded overhead bins.#apr.980.8
u,Many need wheels to move their "carry on" bags through the airport.#apr.980.9
u,Passengers frequently drop bags on other passengers while loading or unloading the bins,#apr.980.10
u,and the overloaded bins occasionally pop open and dump during the flight.#apr.980.11
u,These large bags, especially the wheels, hurt when a bag falls on your head.#apr.980.12
e,I've only gotten one cut and one ringer so far, both since the baggage fee brutality came in.#apr.980.13
e,I witness one accident every third flight.#apr.980.14
u,Please require airlines to allow for some generous weight in checked baggage.#apr.980.15
u,Let it be part of the ticket.#apr.980.16
u,The old limit of 75 pounds domestic was really nice,#apr.980.17
u,but even 30 pounds would be more than plenty.#apr.980.18
u,The passengers hate the baggage charge for many reasons.#apr.980.19
u,It's not just the sleazy entrapment the proposed rule addresses.#apr.980.20
u,It is a safety issue and should be regulated as such.#apr.980.21
u,Fix the root problem.#apr.980.22
u,* Yes, there should be uniform tarmac delay deadline to return to gate and allow passengers to exit the plane,#apr.1028
u,and it should be 2 hours, not 3 hours.#apr.1028
u,Many of us passengers become extremely uncomfortable stuck in an airplane cabin for such long periods, especially when we may then have a several hour or more flight to endure once plane is released for takeoff.#apr.1028
u,* No, extending the plan to smaller carriers is not too burdensome,#apr.1028
u,because the passenger comfort issue is equally bad  on smaller aircraft, or at any airport.#apr.1028
u,* Making the tarmac contingency plan part of the contract of carriage would be much more good, than bad.#apr.1028
u,Explicit written commitments are important, and are a competitive issue that passengers may care about in choosing a carrier for repeated trips.#apr.1028
u,* Yes, airports must have tarmac contingency plans,#apr.1028
u,or too often passengers will be stuck in an aircraft#apr.1028
u,because the airport will not provide a gate or other opportunity for passengers to deplane, when the time limit is exceeded.#apr.1028
u,* Providing for a separate location in an international terminal is appropriate, to allow deplaning without passing through customs.#apr.1028
u,It does not seem unduly burdensome, given the length of many international flights and the consequent greater need to provide for passenger comfort during long delays.#apr.1028
u,* Yes, DOT should require that passengers be allowed to deplane for gate delays with door still open, or returns to gate for mechanical or emergency reasons.#apr.1028
u,Asking passengers to remain in the immediate gate area to listen for boarding announcements, and expecting as passengers to be accountable to do so at the risk of missing our flight if we fail, is also reasonable.#apr.1028
u,The costs and operational concerns should be minimal, with all of this kept in mind.#apr.1028
u,When an airline "bumps" a passenger it is, in essence, "buying" that ticket back from the passenger to sell it to someone else, and then "purchasing" a new ticket for the bumped passenger on the next available flight.#apr.135.0
u,It follows that the airline should pay the prevailing market rate to purchase back the seat in the full flight.#apr.135.1
u,Bumping compensation should apply to all carriers because of the increasing use of regional carriers to serve smaller markets and their no lesser disruptiveness and potential expense to the traveler.#apr.462.0
n,Passengers may lack check cashing privileges away from their home airport, yet face unplanned and likely elevated expenses after being "bumped."#apr.462.1
u,They should have a mandatory option of cash payment.#apr.462.2
u,An credit card credit, if immediate, would be more secure and as useful to more passengers than either a check or cash.#apr.462.3
u,The proposed compensation limits are too low to provide an incentive to the airlines to limit overbooking and may be arbitrarily unfair to certain travelers.#apr.462.4
n,The Wall Street Journal recently re-proposed a 1977 proposal by the late economist Julian Simon of an auction that would offer bumped passengers a gradually rising reward for giving up their seat.#apr.462.5
u,The arguments are rather compelling.#apr.462.6
u,The airlines will overbook so as to optimize their financial results under any given set of caps,#apr.573.0
u,so some passengers will still be involuntarily denied boarding on overbooked flights.#apr.573.1
u,An auction will more accurately price the delay and the sellers  will be left with no complaint that it was involuntary.#apr.573.2
u,An auction would also force the carriers to face the cost of overbooking in customer dissatisfaction and better inform their flight scheduling decisions.#apr.573.3
e,I recall hearing seats being auctioned by progressive increases in the promised compensation by gate agents,#apr.573.4
u,but that was long, long ago and under far greater seat availability and lower probabilities of cascading delays and subsequent denials of boarding for those who took the compensation.#apr.573.5
e,Those procedures were surely regulated by DOT,#apr.573.6
u,so perhaps those earlier rules should be revisited.#apr.573.7
u,I support uniform regulations requiring both airlines and ticket agents to disclose all fees online  before purchase, for all flights and all carriers.#apr.1030.0
u,3 months of notification of changes on an airline's web page is too short, especially for less-frequent fliers.#apr.1030.1
u,No other industry gets away with the pricing gimmicks and gotchas that the airline industry does;#apr.1030.2
u,it's not a free market if we never know the real price we pay for a service.#apr.1030.3
u,Regulations should be as uniform as possible and applied uniformly.#apr.1030.4
e,I have two sister in laws and a brother in law and two friends that have children that are allergic to peanuts and or  or all nuts.#apr.976.0
e,On a flight with American airlines I was with my sister in law that is deadly allergic to peanuts.#apr.976.1
e,I asked the flight attendant not to sell peanuts on the flight.#apr.976.2
e,She came back with the regulation book explaining that the company policy was not to accommodate her.#apr.976.3
e,I did clearly explain that if peanut dust is in the air it will cause her a sever assma attack.#apr.976.4
e,They did nothing to help us and did offer to sell peanuts on the flight.#apr.976.5
e,My sister in law took benadrel and was very scard for the entire flight.#apr.976.6
e,She did get filled up but didn't have an attack.#apr.976.7
e,She is very afraid to fly.#apr.976.8
u,Why don't they just serve snacks that don't have the potential  to kill someone!!!!!#apr.976.9
u,I would support a full ban of peanut products on any airline.#apr.109.0
n,Peanut reactions can be life threatening.#apr.109.1
u,An individual doesn't have to consume the product to have a life threatening reaction.#apr.109.2
n,They can have contact or inhalation reactions.#apr.109.3
u,Restricting to certain flights is not enough,#apr.109.4
u,as residue can be rampant.#apr.109.5
u,Providing buffer zones is a thoughtful gesture, but from a practical point of view does not work.#apr.109.6
e,I am a physician , and author on the subject.#apr.109.7
e,I have free food allergy online support forums with 3000 members.#apr.109.8
u,I would be more than willing to work with you in any way on this decision making process.#apr.110.0
u,Feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.#apr.110.1
n,Here is a link to that study#apr.125.0
u,I'm quite interested to hear,#apr.778.0
e,as this is my focus in a lot of my research,#apr.778.1
u,and I have had much trouble finding examples.#apr.778.2
u,I also think it should be noted that a lot of airlines do follow some of these rules on their own, and would most likely lose out on a lot of business without adopting such options.#apr.779.0
u,That being said, if I would like to travel on the cheap, realizing that it could come at a cost of worse customer service, in a lot of situations, I'd be willing to live with poorer service for lower prices.#apr.779.1
e,I am a university student,#apr.784.0
e,and I'm not doing anything this summer,#apr.784.1
e,but I have done free market research for different papers and what not for school, and helped a professor with work on F.A. Hayek and Ayn Rand.#apr.784.2
n,So, nothing specifically about airlines, but markets and regulations in general, and most of what I have read  points to all evidence showing regulations being counter-productive.#apr.784.3
u,This comment to me shows that we don't need regulation.#apr.905.0
u,If people behave the way that Bernice does, choosing to no longer fly with an airline that does not provide adequate customer service, these customers "vote" with their money saying that this experience needs to be fixed,#apr.905.1
u,or else we will take our business elsewhere.#apr.905.2
u,It really is in the airlines' best interests to serve customers well in order to retain customers and gain a good reputation to get more customers.#apr.905.3
u,In a competitive industry, being able to separate your company as being better than the rest gives you a huge advantage.#apr.905.4
u,Without government control, businesses can, and will, do whatever they please, no matter how bad it is for their cusomers.#apr.1258.0
u,THAT'S WHY WE NEED REGULATIONS LIKE THIS!#apr.1258.1
u,I, for one, don't mind seeing tax dollars go for this purpose!#apr.1258.2
u,I believe airlines should be forced to fully reimburse confirmed passengers whenever the airline changes flight schedules after booking.#apr.876.0
e,I frequently reserve flights up to one year in advance, in order to secure the lowest price and best seat.#apr.876.1
e,I do this even though the airline will charge me $150  to change my itinerary for personal reasons once booked.#apr.876.2
n,However, the airline frequently change flight schedules for confirmed passengers without compensation, nor consideration of passengers' plans.#apr.876.3
e,For example, a trip to Europe on United Airlines has now been changed 7 times by the airline since I confirmed my reservation in December 2009.#apr.876.4
e,The resulting changes have added nearly 5 hours to the total trip,#apr.876.5
e,plus I'm now required to leave at 3AM for the airport ,#apr.876.6
e,and I return after midnight, rather than a more reasonable 10:30PM.#apr.876.7
e,In addition, United Airlines has not offered to waive the change fee, nor provide seats on alternate dates or airline partners.#apr.876.8
u,If I'm required to pay exorbitant fees to the airlines to change my original itinerary, due to personal circumstances, then the airlines should also be required to compensate inconvenienced passengers in full AND provide satisfactory alternate travel arrangements comparable to the original flight schedule.#apr.876.9
u,Perhaps this would force the airlines to recognize the hardships they create for passengers when schedules are revised after passengers have already received confirmed flights and make related travel arrangements.#apr.876.10
u,Well, a peanut allergy should be known in children flying,#apr.629.0
u,but sadly, too often it is too late then.#apr.629.1
u,I do not back banning peanuts, but even in doubt, a child would get peanuts, when they can produce proof of no such allergy, if in doubt, give something else.#apr.629.2
u,A law that prevents harm, does not have to be a blanket law.#apr.629.3
u,There are intelligent ways to do this.#apr.629.4
u,There is a way, to tell someone whether or not a patient is allergic to peanuts.#apr.629.5
u,It could be part of a passport.#apr.629.6
e,Unable to make corrections of duplicate name and misspelled name to online reservations on AA website.#apr.588.0
e,AA was supposed to send a confirmation to my e-mail address and did not.#apr.588.1
e,After the flight, I now have to jump through hoops to get a copy of the reservation for my use.#apr.588.2
e,I needed to call Spirit Airline directly to get a refund for a paid reservation during their strike instead of having them automatically contact me about refunding my purchase price.#apr.588.3
e,I am the father of a 5-year old with a severe peanut allergy as well as a physician and a medical epidemiologist.#apr.710.0
u,While I have been fortunate enough to not experience an anaphylactic reaction in my son,#apr.710.1
e,I have seen patients with anaphylactic reactions.#apr.710.2
u,They are terrifying for everyone involved, even in situations where you are surrounded by trained staff, abundant medications and crash carts.#apr.710.3
u,The way I see this issue is that it is balancing the risks and benefits of peanuts on planes.#apr.710.4
u,The risks are pretty obvious and encompass death and less severe reactions that, at a minimum, are likely to result in an emergency landing.#apr.710.5
u,The benefits of serving peanuts on planes are limited to the fact that most people like peanuts and they are fairly inexpensive.#apr.710.6
e,I have seen on this discussion board arguments that people have the right to eat peanuts, that people with allergies should wear masks or other personal protective equipment , that people with allergies should not fly, etc...#apr.710.7
u,These arguments seem somewhat petty, impractical, and outdated, respectively.#apr.710.8
u,Petty because it is not a major sacrifice to go without a bag of peanuts.#apr.710.9
u,Impractical because trying to keep an N95  mask on a young child for up to 6 hours just cannot happen.#apr.710.10
u,Outdated because in modern US society with families spread across the nation travel is often the norm.#apr.710.11
u,For people who say 'Just don't travel on planes', I assert that they are missing the point.#apr.710.12
u,It is not as if dealing with a severe allergy is not already lifestyle altering.#apr.710.13
u,I will never be able to take my son to a major league baseball park;#apr.710.14
u,we will never be able to go down the street for ice cream on a hot summer day;#apr.710.15
u,we cannot go to a Chinese restaurant.#apr.710.16
u,This is all OK#apr.710.17
u,because these are luxuries.#apr.710.18
u,Furthermore, if we somehow do find ourselves in a hazardous situation, we can just get up and leave.#apr.710.19
u,On an airplane, that is not an option.#apr.710.20
u,There is no getting up and leaving .#apr.710.21
u,So, the way I see it is that the risks associated with serving peanuts in a closed environment where the ability to provide medical care is limited clearly outweigh the benefits of serving peanuts both on a societal and cultural level#apr.710.22
u,because the very real risk faced by children and adults with severe peanut allergies far exceeds the benefit of airlines serving peanuts.#apr.710.23
u,This is a clear choice.#apr.710.24
u,There is nothing that I am aware of that has not been recently publicized.#apr.714.0
n,* Peanut allergies are likely common;#apr.714.1
n,* and Serum IgE testing likely overestimates the number of people with clinically significant peanut allergies.#apr.714.2
u,Still, this high rate of elevate IgE could presage trends to come.#apr.714.3
u,The major problem is that some cases of peanut allergy are obvious#apr.714.4
u,while others are of uncertain significance.#apr.714.5
n,But, it appears that the prevalence of children with clinically significant peanut allergy is increasing#apr.714.6
u,which means in a few years that the prevalence will also increase in adults.#apr.714.7
n,Why the prevalence is increasing remains a mystery.#apr.714.8
u,Essentially, the key with this, as with everything in life, is to minimize risk while maximizing feasibility.#apr.721.0
u,An absolute ban on peanut products is not currently possible,#apr.721.1
u,but it is possible to increase the protection of passengers with life threatening allergies with minimal inconvenience to other passengers.#apr.721.2
u,Please everyone on this site, be reasonable, accommodating and, if possible, kind to others.#apr.721.3
u,There is a question of practicality here.#apr.730.0
n,Peanut allergies  at the current time are becoming increasingly common in children.#apr.730.1
u,While I appreciate that a person may require peanuts to be 'comfortable' as asserted by csleep2,#apr.730.2
u,I would ask this individual to consider this proposition more fully,#apr.730.3
u,as I suspect that 6 hours of screaming from said toddler while the distraught parent struggles valiantly to keep the surgical mask in place will result in far greater discomfort than the loss of the 2 ounce bag of airplane peanuts.#apr.730.4
u,But I could be wrong -#apr.730.5
u,airplane passengers embracing the concept of N95 masks on children may actually rejoice at the idea of 6 hours with a screaming child because, well, peanuts are just that important to their quality of life#apr.730.6
u,and a brief peanut deprivation would quite simply be too devastating to even fathom.#apr.730.7
u,I am actually focusing on feasibility and weighing risks against benefits .#apr.732.0
u,But, yes, I do reject the concept that having a toddler suit and mask up for 6 hours is feasible.#apr.732.1
e,I actually have,#apr.732.2
u,and I found it quite uncomfortable.#apr.732.3
u,Critically, I have the willpower and the motivation to keep it in place#apr.732.4
u,because I am an adult and have the ability to modify my behavior when faced with logical demands.#apr.732.5
u,Toddlers do not have this ability.#apr.732.6
u,So now balance this against the idea of airlines needing to serve peanuts at 35,000 feet.#apr.732.7
u,It seems fairly straightforward to me.#apr.732.8
u,Personally, if you want to bring your Snickers bar on-board and eat it, that is fine.#apr.732.9
u,But, I do not want to be sitting anywhere near you with my child when this occurs.#apr.732.10
u,This is not a 'take it or leave it' approach, but rather a balanced approach that weighs risks versus inconvenience for peanut consumers.#apr.732.11
u,Individual masks are not a practical solution for the most vulnerable passengers.#apr.732.12
u,I agree with Steyermark's comments in many ways -#apr.741.0
u,a full ban on peanut products is unenforceable and not practical.#apr.741.1
e,In my family, we read labels, understand where the labels may not give all of the information, etc...#apr.741.2
u,This is not something that will be done by the majority of people.#apr.741.3
u,Also, foods like PBJ sandwiches are really easy to fly with - no refrigeration required.#apr.741.4
u,Overall, I can foresee that this may be a bit inconvenient and people affected may find this to be an annoyance,#apr.741.5
u,but, in the grand scheme of things, this is not that big of a deal.#apr.741.6
u,A policy could consist of identifying those in close proximity to the peanut-allergic individual and giving them a handout that asks if they have peanut products that they are going to be eating.#apr.741.7
u,If so, they should notify the flight attendant and some sort of seating rearrangement will occur in a way to maximize safety and minimize inconvenience.#apr.741.8
u,This will require flexibility and generosity of spirit on the part of all people involved#apr.741.9
u,but, in truth, is not that big of a deal when compared to a significant safety issue.#apr.741.10
u,The other factor here is that I am, in truth, less worried about a nearby PBJ sandwich or a Snickers bar than I am about a bag of raw peanuts as these foods are less likely to have particles that go airborne.#apr.741.11
u,It does not mean that I am unconcerned#apr.741.12
n,but just that they pose less risk.#apr.741.13
u,Finally, if necessary, I am more than prepared to either 1 give an affected passenger food that we brought on the plane that is peanut safe if they are really hungry  or#apr.741.14
u,will gladly fork over the additional $5-$50 to buy them or their family whatever in-flight food they want if it means that they will not expose my family to peanut allergens in close proximity.#apr.741.15
u,I would love to see a full ban -#apr.743.0
u,for those with allergies, it is clearly optimal.#apr.743.1
u,I do not think it is possible at this time though.#apr.743.2
u,What about 'possible contamination' or 'shares equipment' labels, etc...#apr.743.3
u,I know that I will never feel secure when flying on a plane with my son , just as I am never secure in a restaurant and just as we always make sure to have his epi-pens with us.#apr.743.4
u,The above would be a huge advance for people with food allergies,#apr.743.5
u,and, maybe in the future, it will be able to go further.#apr.743.6
u,But, for now, I do not see how it is practical.#apr.743.7
u,It's very simple.#apr.930.0
u,I should be able to buy a flight for the price advertised in large print.#apr.930.1
u,If the ad says $49 from SFO to LAX, then that's what I should be paying.#apr.930.2
u,If it is not a one-way price, then it should be listed as $98 round trip.#apr.930.3
u,If there are other fees, then the listed price should include those fees.#apr.930.4
u,It's simple - just be honest.#apr.930.5
n,This must be a very rare condition.#apr.719.0
e,I've traveled extensively, both domestically and internationally, on airlines for fifty years and have never seen a person on an airplane have a peanut allergy attack.#apr.719.1
u,Also, this may be closing the barn door after the horse has run away.#apr.719.2
e,I have celiac disease and hypoglycemia.#apr.642.0
e,Last time I flew, it was a fairly long flight#apr.642.1
e,but the airline had informed us that food other than packaged snacks was to be offered.#apr.642.2
e,I purchased some safe, gluten-free trail mix at the airport and tossed it into my carry-on#apr.642.3
e,so that I could have something to eat.#apr.642.4
e,It had dried fruit, nuts, and included peanuts.#apr.642.5
u,My concern was gluten, not peanuts.#apr.642.6
e,There was a child with a peanut allergy on the plane and not only did the flight crew refuse to serve peanuts to the entire plane,#apr.642.7
e,but I was asked to put away the gluten-free trail mix I had just bought IN THE AIRPORT.#apr.642.8
u,I would have eaten something else to keep my blood sugar up,#apr.642.9
e,but every single snack on that plane other than the peanuts contained gluten.#apr.642.10
u,I came off the three hour flight dizzy, sick, hypoglycemic, and furious.#apr.642.11
u,If DOT is going to restrict peanuts on planes it needs to be CLEARLY COMMUNICATED ON THE TICKET AND IN ADVANCE.#apr.642.12
u,It's easy to bring foods without peanuts but only if you know to do so.#apr.642.13
u,That should be "no food other than packaged snacks."#apr.643.0
u,You have no idea what you're talking about either.#apr.736.0
u,Celiac disease is not an "allergy" and someone sitting in the next seat eating pretzels poses no risk to a celiac.#apr.736.1
n,Even if a celiac ingests trace gluten, the reaction is uncomfortable, not life-threatening.#apr.736.2
u,On the off-chance there is turbulence and somebody's pretzel lands in my drink, I'm sure the airline would replace it.#apr.736.3
u,Not only advertise TOTAL fare- but whether or not the fare is refundable.#apr.1622.0
u,Also - beyond the fare - the airlines are adding "FUEL SURCHARGES" to almost all international fares.#apr.1622.1
u,The Fuel Surcharges need to be described as either refundable or non-refundable as well.#apr.1622.2
u,This goes too far.#apr.163.0
n,Enough is enough.#apr.1070.0
u,Either you know you can get off the ground in an hour or you don't.#apr.1070.1
u,If in doubt, deplane.#apr.1070.2
u,The airports are obsolete,#apr.1070.3
n,the ATC system is at least twenty years out of date,#apr.1070.4
n,there are too many people and too little capacity--#apr.1070.5
u,so adjust.#apr.1070.6
u,All advertising of fares must state a total price, inclusive, without limiting in any way the generality of either or both of the foregoing or the following, of every cost, fee, charge, tax, device, scheme, gimmick and ripoff, in clearly readable type, not less than 12 point , prominently in each such advertisement.#apr.1071.0
u,Baggage isn't optional.#apr.1072.0
u,The daytripper is a distinct minority.#apr.1072.1
u,Fares should include one  checked and one carryon, subject to size and weight limits.#apr.1072.2
u,Right now the premium is on smuggling oversized and overweight baggage and robbing other passengers of scarce storage space#apr.1072.3
u,When it's in an airline contract of carriage.#apr.1073.0
u,The rule should require every air carrier to tell all plainly and clearly, and back it up.#apr.1073.1
u,I don't want the government to make a one-size-fits-all mandate#apr.1073.2
u,they're not so good at that.#apr.1073.3
u,Just make the carriers tell it plainly and put it in the contract.#apr.1073.4
n,Although DOT does not seem to present this option,#apr.1174.0
u,I am most concerned about the byzantine price structuring for air fares that have no basis in actual cost of the service rendered.#apr.1174.1
u,Air travel is a form of public transportation that is subsidized by taxes - and should be regulated as such when fares are set.#apr.1174.2
u,Caps should be eliminated and actual monetary cost should be reimbursed - or an equivalent voucher for future travel should be provided.#apr.1186.0
u,If the traveler cannot be booked on a timely alternate flight, the compensation should be equal to the lost flight and some additional compensation - perhaps double the cost.#apr.1186.1
u,A flyer with concise and clearly stated rules and obligations of the passenger and the airline should be presented to any passenger in advance of a decision regarding compensation.#apr.1186.2
u,Gate agents should be required to tell individuals that there are a range of options that are included when they make their announcements asking for volunteers.#apr.1186.3
u,Placing this information on the airline websites at booking - and on the e-boarding passes that most people print are other options to inform non-frequent flyers about their rights.#apr.1186.4
u,Frequent-flyer miles should be refunded double their miles - to be in line with the compensation provided regular flyers.#apr.1186.5
u,I am 100% in favor of banning peanuts from planes.#apr.466.0
u,I was in favor of this before my 3 year old was diagnosed with a peanut allergy#apr.466.1
e,because I knew how serious reactions could be#apr.466.2
u,and I certainly remain in favor now.#apr.466.3
n,Food allergies are becoming more and more common#apr.466.4
n,and you can get food allergies at any point in your life#apr.466.5
u,so people should not think that this "only concerns someone else or someone else's kid"#apr.466.6
n,because it could very well concern YOU and your family at some point...#apr.466.7
n,People do not need peanuts to survive#apr.466.8
n,but those who are allergic DO need a peanut free area to survive.#apr.466.9
n,If no one cares about anyone but themselves, at least realize that if peanuts are served on a flight and someone has a reaction, your plane will have to make an emergency landing.#apr.466.10
u,That's not something that anyone wants.#apr.466.11
n,Handling Tarmac delays requires coordination between the airline and the local airport.#apr.984.0
n,The cause of the delay could be anything in the transportation system, ground or flight equipment problems, local or destination weather, crew issues,etc.,#apr.984.1
u,but the accommodation of the passengers relies on the airport's ability to handle them.#apr.984.2
u,Therefore, the airline must work with each airport it serves to develop a plan for that airline at that airport.#apr.984.3
u,A clause in the Contract of Carriage could require that the airline establish a Tarmac Delay Contingency Plan with each airport the airline uses.#apr.1025.0
u,Furthermore, the airline must keep relevant ststistics about delays and their handling, conduct periodic reviews and revise the plan with the goal of improving customer satisfaction and reducing the causes for the delays .#apr.1025.1
u,I think anything more specific would be unworkable.#apr.1025.2
e,As an adult with a severe tree nut allergy,#apr.194.0
u,I certainly empathize with the folks with peanut allergies.#apr.194.1
u,That said, it seems arbitrary to ban peanuts and not tree nuts given the likelihood of a serious reaction is fairly similar.#apr.194.2
u,If the airlines could have precautions in place, such as keeping an epipen available or offering surgical masks to those who need then, that would be a positive step.#apr.194.3
u,However, supplying those items really should be the responsibility of the person with the allergy or, if it is a child, the caretaker.#apr.194.4
u,Further, the logistics of implementing such a ban would be almost impossible.#apr.194.5
u,Unfortunately, personal responsibility and proactive steps on the part of the person with the allergy is likely the only viable solution.#apr.194.6
u,There are times when it is obvious to the airline and passengers that a flight is going to be canceled#apr.1243.0
n,and yet the airline often requires passengers to arrive at the airport in order to "qualify" for rebooking or refund.#apr.1243.1
u,It would make more sense that in order to avoid misery at the airport  airlines should allow passengers to rebook or refund when a cancellation or severe delay is imminent.#apr.1243.2
u,I'm sure that an algorithm can be developed and supported by software to create a baseline for appropriate situations.#apr.1243.3
e,My peanut allergic son flew with me on Southwest when he was 3.#apr.448.0
e,I carried him in, wiped the whole area down while holding him, etc. etc.#apr.448.1
e,Picked up the food all around#apr.448.2
e,I had let SW know about his allergy on several occasions before we boarded#apr.448.3
e,but nothing was done.#apr.448.4
e,He didn't touch one thing#apr.448.5
e,and he sat in his very large car seat the whole time.#apr.448.6
e,About 30 min. into the flight, his eyes were swollen shut#apr.448.7
e,and his face was bright red... just from breathing#apr.448.8
e,I let the flight attendant know#apr.448.9
e,but all she said was "I hope you have your medicine".#apr.448.10
e,THIS WAS A THREE YEAR OLD!#apr.448.11
u,It was really scary.#apr.448.12
e,Thankfully, I did have his medicine#apr.448.13
e,but I have never flown with him since.#apr.448.14
u,It makes me REALLY sad to hear all of your comments about banning other foods, animals, perfumes, etc.#apr.448.15
u,You know that is not the intention.#apr.448.16
u,How insensitive, especially to those of us who have lost a child or a loved one to such a small thing as a PEANUT.#apr.448.17
u,No one would EVER wish this upon their child.#apr.448.18
u,It is not something we have chosen.#apr.448.19
u,It is a dark shadow that we have to live with every day.#apr.448.20
e,Personally, I teach my children to love and respect all people, in all circumstances.#apr.448.21
u,I would hope others are doing the same.#apr.448.22
u,This is what has happened to us, just this month.#apr.448.23
u,It's really sad.#apr.448.24
u,I can't even tell my son about it.#apr.448.25
u,So, obviously, I would support the ban of peanuts on planes.#apr.448.26
u,I don't even care if someone brings them on board#apr.448.27
u,but packaged peanuts are a different story.#apr.448.28
u,The oils on your hands are on those fabric seats forever#apr.448.29
u,and the peanut POOF is in the ventilation system for everyone to breathe.#apr.448.30
n,In regards to medicines, someone mentioned earlier about a defibrillator being on board.#apr.448.31
u,They are prepared for heart problems#apr.448.32
u,but a child's first reaction to peanuts is just as likely and deadly,#apr.448.33
u,so maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to have one.#apr.448.34
u,Although, I can't imagine someone with a peanut allergy coming on board without their medicines.#apr.448.35
n,On a side note, someone commented about how this would only effect 1% of the population.#apr.448.36
u,I'm not sure about that number.#apr.448.37
e,But, I do know that out my family of 5, NONE of us can fly with my child...#apr.448.38
e,so not only does my son not fly, but we don't.#apr.448.39
u,I would venture to say that this is the same case for most families.#apr.448.40
u,So, much more than 1% would be e or affected.#apr.448.41
u,Peanuts should never be banned anywhere!#apr.508.0
u,Best food for the size available.#apr.508.1
u,If my kid's school were to attempt to ban them, they would be the target of a discrimination lawsuit.#apr.508.2
n,Food allergies are incredibly rare.#apr.508.3
u,Most people who believe they are allergic only think so because their parents misinformed them out of total paranoia.#apr.508.4
u,I just have to say, Yeah right.#apr.509.0
u,Foolish paranoia is the real illness in most supposed food allergy cases.#apr.509.1
u,Absolutely!#apr.510.0
u,I think the fact that she survived the people next to her having peanuts indicates that the fear is baseless.#apr.510.1
n,Southwest DOES serve peanuts  unless you impose your paranoia on the rest of us and request a peanut free flight.#apr.511.0
u,Allergist has an agenda.#apr.512.0
u,the fact that he has never reacted is more telling than any suggestion by the self-servig allergist.#apr.512.1
n,More than 31 people drop dead each day FOR NO REASON.#apr.513.0
n,Food allergies are so rare,#apr.513.1
u,that the rest of the world should not concern themselves.#apr.513.2
u,IF you have a problem  then it is up to YOU to take precautions!#apr.513.3
n,Other than death by choking, it IS NOT a fact that peanuts kill people.#apr.516.0
u,It is a fact that they provide a very nutritious snack that children will actually eat.#apr.516.1
u,If your paranoid imaginings are too sever for you to allow the rest of the traveling public to enjoy a snack in peace, STAY HOME!#apr.516.2
n,Highly unlikely that you AND two of your offspring actually suffer from the same allergy.#apr.518.0
n,Allergies are not genetic.#apr.518.1
u,Therefore, I must classify you as a hypochondriac.#apr.518.2
u,Unfortunately your paranoia is robbing your kids of one of the most nutritious foods  on the planet.#apr.518.3
u,So true!#apr.519.0
e,I see this all the time.#apr.519.1
n,They try to ban peanuts at school#apr.519.2
u,because some over anxious mom saw something on TV about food allergies#apr.519.3
e,and that became her kids affliction du jour.#apr.519.4
n,Peanuts are harmless to 99.99999% of humans.#apr.519.5
u,The 3 living humans who are actually in danger just need to stay in a bubble and leave the rest of us in peace.#apr.519.6
n,We have tons of anecdotal evidence,#apr.1074.0
u,but this is one where hard, verifiable, replicable evidence is needed.#apr.1074.1
u,If peanuts are life-threatening, then surely there are cost-efficient equivalents.#apr.1074.2
e,Frankly, I avoid airlines "snacks"--#apr.1074.3
u,they interfere with my drinking.#apr.1074.4
e,My 9 year old peanut-allergic son had his last major exposure 2 years ago when he touched a smear of peanut butter left under a tabletop where someone else had touched.#apr.265.0
e,He then wiped his hand on his jeans and then touched his ear and his cheek.#apr.265.1
e,All without realizing it was peanut butter he'd touched.#apr.265.2
e,He immediately broke out in horrible hives#apr.265.3
e,and I gave him benadryl and got him home, stripped and bathed.#apr.265.4
e,All the while, I was watching for breathing problems and other signs of anaphylaxis.#apr.265.5
u,This is why I don't support buffer zones alone.#apr.265.6
u,They don't address peanuts stuck down in cushions, left in seatbacks or peanut product oils left, well, anywhere by earlier passengers or flights.#apr.265.7
u,I don't feel it is a viable solution as a "peanut-free" flight could follow a "peanut-allowed" flight on the same plane.#apr.268.0
u,Leaving peanuts in cushions and peanut residue on everything from the prior flight.#apr.268.1
u,This is a very good point and a lot of parallels can be drawn.#apr.269.0
u,I think the problem, as seen with JJM, is that some people don't view peanuts in the same category as guns and cigarettes.#apr.274.0
u,These things kill.#apr.274.1
u,Just because they  won't kill YOU doesn't make it your right to expose others to it.#apr.274.2
u,It's a matter of education.#apr.274.3
u,We'll get there.#apr.274.4
u,This dialogue is a good step.#apr.274.5
n,A peanut-free table is less likely to have smears of peanut butter on or under it.#apr.275.0
u,Risk of exposure is reduced#apr.275.1
u,which is not as good as eliminated but is better than full exposure.#apr.275.2
u,I see the parallel with these flight proposals.#apr.275.3
u,Ban peanut products.#apr.275.4
u,Yes, people will "sneak" them.#apr.275.5
n,However, the risk will still be reduced over the nothing that we are doing now.#apr.275.6
u,I think a buffer-zone would be a more realistic approach to the issue than select peanut-free flights.#apr.138.0
u,Your suspicions about who is behind this are just your clouded musings.#apr.751.0
n,There is real data showing allergic reactions to peanut dust in the aircraft.#apr.751.1
u,The fact that you are uninformed does not mean the evidence does not exist.#apr.751.2
u,A willingness to go without peanuts for the duration of a flight is a small show of civility and empathy.#apr.751.3
e,Our family flies regularly and internationally.#apr.751.4
e,We are very careful and inform the airlines of our child's allergy.#apr.751.5
u,It would be a life-saving and life-changing regulation if peanuts were banned on all flights.#apr.751.6
u,People who like peanuts can simply eat a giant bag after the plane lands.#apr.751.7
u,It is good for your personal growth to be able to think of other people's needs.#apr.751.8
e,My son has a severe peanut allergy diagnosed by respected allergy doctors#apr.742.0
u,so it is not paranoia.#apr.742.1
n,The part about food allergies  is that each reaction can be different.#apr.742.2
n,One exposure can simply lead to hives or vomiting, while another exposure can trigger full anaphylactic shock#apr.742.3
n,which may be fatal, if untreated.#apr.742.4
u,Some people my only react when the item is ingested or some when comes into contact with the skin.#apr.742.5
u,This issue is not a joke or to be taken lightly.#apr.742.6
u,Consider this.#apr.742.7
n,The epi-pen emergency medication is  effective for 15-20 minutes per dose before the patient needs to get to the hospital.#apr.742.8
u,If you were on the plane with my son and he has an allergic reaction on a flight from the East Coast to the West Coast, he would need to take several epi-pens in case an emergency landing would be necessary.#apr.742.9
u,I wish no one would have to deal with this issue.#apr.742.10
u,I don't relish the fact that we would inconvenience other travelers,#apr.742.11
u,but I think that if it was your child you may think differently.#apr.742.12
e,We deal with this on a daily basis and have only travelled by plane one time.#apr.742.13
u,We contacted the airline in advance, found the first flight of the day to ensure the plane was as clean as possible, took several epi-pens, covered the seats with towels and worried the whole time and that was only 1.5 hours.#apr.742.14
u,My vote would be to ban peanuts and peanut products only on a flight where a passenger with a peanut allergy requests a peanut-free flight in advance.#apr.742.15
u,Get serious.#apr.408.0
u,Maybe some passengers like peanuts.#apr.409.0
u,Why not just require the flight attendants to warn you, and only give you peanuts if you ask for them.#apr.409.1
u,The same for anything containing peanut products.#apr.409.2
u,I think opening the floor for public comment is helpful on so many levels.#apr.212.0
u,Those of us dealing with food allergy issues on a day-to-day basis feel that the opportunity to have our voices heard is exactly what we would wish for.#apr.212.1
u,Those in the public who do not or have not lived with this issue can see a variety of viewpoints and develop an informed opinion.#apr.212.2
u,I believe that our cultural expectations need to be re-assesed when considering food allergy issues.#apr.212.3
n,* Food is sustenance#apr.212.4
u,* We associate events or environments with food#apr.212.5
u,* We hold onto traditions rather strongly until forced to evaluate the extent to which they are truly meaningful and necessary.#apr.212.6
u,If I eat this food, I may seriously jeopardize someone's well-being.#apr.212.7
u,I believe that good faith is being shown in evaluating the peanut allergy issue,#apr.212.8
n,not just peanuts cause life-threatening reactions.#apr.212.9
u,I strongly encourage you to contact and work in tandem with the Food Allergy and Anaphlyaxis Network, t_url#apr.212.10
u,They have worked tirelessly to serve as a clearinghouse of information on these very issues.#apr.212.11
u,I believe that people generally care about the well-being of others, and when informed, make informed choices.#apr.212.12
u,What industry other then approved monopolies have this privilege.#apr.867.0
u,As consumers we are not given full information of costs,#apr.867.1
n,we can be bumped at the airlines discretion,#apr.867.2
n,and they can sell non-existent seats without fear of refund.#apr.867.3
u,The DOT is failing us by allowing airlines to over sell and issue non-refundable tickets.#apr.867.4
u,The DOT should require all tickets to be fully refundable  and allow the airlines to oversell.#apr.867.5
u,I believe that the airlines should be required to pay 5 times the full ticket price#apr.868.0
u,This will act as a disincentive and return sanity and civility to the experience.#apr.868.1
u,Payment should be required to be  released immediately at the gate in the form of "as good as cash" medium upon being advised of bumping.#apr.868.2
u,Additionally, passengers should be rebooked in the first available flight on the airline of  the customer's choosing.#apr.868.3
u,The non-revenue tickets should be considered as those that are bought.#apr.868.4
n,It is already impossible to travel on earned "miles" .#apr.868.5
u,If the airlines would guarantee 30-35% of the aircraft seating  as mile redeemable priority seating that would be another story.#apr.868.6
u,But as it stands currently unless you are considering flying to a war zone in the middle of the night on Sunday you never can find a revenue free seat.#apr.868.7
u,The bottom line is that you cannot trust the airlines to be customer friendly until their actual revenue stream is threatened by thei bad behavior.#apr.868.8
u,Small aircraft should not be over-sold, period!#apr.868.9
u,Finally, along with the ticket and in the same size font full disclosure of bumping regulation should be provided.#apr.868.10
u,That way the customer has the information in hand and is able to ensure that he or she is properly advised.#apr.868.11
n,There has also been many reported incidences of credits taking months if not years to be provided by airlines.#apr.872.0
u,The DOT should require INSTANTANEOUS credits.#apr.872.1
u,Our debit or credit cards should be credited within the same time frame as they were debited for the original purchase.#apr.872.2
u,Any delay should warrant a substantial fine.#apr.872.3
u,Well stated and I am in full agreement.#apr.873.0
u,The terms should be part of the contract of carriage.#apr.998.0
u,Interpretations should never be left to the side that is contracted and paid to provide the service.#apr.998.1
n,We have seen that behavior with the cable companies#apr.998.2
u,The DOT should require compensation for both fees and lost bags.#apr.998.3
u,If the bag shows up later and is sent to the traveler at his or her convenience the traveler may opt in to reverse that lost bag charge.#apr.998.4
u,If the bag is not there when you get off the plane it is lost period.#apr.998.5
u,We have enough modern technology to insure that lost bags are a rare exception.#apr.998.6
u,If the passenger cannot get to his or her destination within  2 hours of the scheduled arrival the traveler should have the right to have a refund for any ticket immediately and on the spot and for the amount paid inclusive of all fees.#apr.998.7
u,If they want to publish the history tat is fine as long as it is accurate and certified so by a third party.#apr.998.8
u,There is absolutely no reason to prevent a traveler from suing.#apr.998.9
u,Whichever regulation that governs foreign carriers that is more favorable to the traveler should be the effective one.#apr.998.10
u,Size has no relevancy as far as I am concerned.#apr.1001.0
u,All foreign airlines flying into or out of the US airspace should be bound by the same rules.#apr.1001.1
u,It is but a fraction of what the airlines spend to misrepresent their service to the gullible flying public.#apr.1003.0
u,Add that to the amount of legal gymnastics the public is put through to seek recovery of costs due to non delivery of service.#apr.1003.1
u,And while there the tortoise-like speed of having a  credit card  debit reversed.#apr.1003.2
u,I have no problem with near regulation of the industry again.#apr.1003.3
u,While the passenger has a right to know what fees are being charged by the airlines,#apr.1122.0
u,when the ticket is purchased, it should be inclusive of any and all fees.#apr.1122.1
u,I have always been opposed to carry-on bags that don't fit under the seat.#apr.1122.2
u,Delays in boarding are caused by people trying to "stuff" their bag in the overhead compartment.#apr.1122.3
u,If the carry-on is too large to fit, then the passenger should be charged a fee for those carry-on bags.#apr.1122.4
u,I agree with the comments that mthornt1 has posted.#apr.1122.5
u,There is NEVER an excuse for leaving an aircraft on the ground for more than 3 hours;#apr.1123.0
u,rather, an airline's choice to do so is likely governed by the cost of returning the aircraft to the gate.#apr.1123.1
u,The thought that an organization deemed qualified to routinely operate and maintain something as complex as a modern airliner might respond that they 'can't' avoid imprisoning people on an airplane is absurd.#apr.1123.2
u,The rules should apply to all carriers and all airports.#apr.1123.3
u,Further additional rulemaking should insure that when aircraft are on the ground, whether at the gate or not, adequate climate control and airflow be required in addition to access to toilets and water.#apr.1123.4
u,Additional rules should require carriers to allow access to one another's gates on a barter basis or at reasonable cost if there is a need to deboard an airplane.#apr.1123.5
u,Lastly, penalties for violations should benefit the affected passengers ' only when there is a direct cost to mistreating and delaying passengers will there be a sufficient incentive for carriers to treat passengers humanely.#apr.1123.6
u,It's about time that passengers had some sort of recourse.#apr.42.0
e,I missed multiple connections due to the fact that the plane I was on was grounded without any explanation from the staff - not to mention the lost luggage stories.#apr.42.1
u,Imagine being stuck in China without a change of clothes.#apr.42.2
u,Thanks a lot airlines#apr.42.3
n,I think airlines know well in advance which flights are subject to being over sold and have repeated bumping.#apr.43.0
u,For repeated bumping on the same flight same day of the week three or more weeks in a row, the specified compensation should double.#apr.43.1
u,Airlines should also notify passengeres when a flight is being significantly oversold and offer the denied boarding compensation in advance of the departure date for say 50% of the denied boarding compensation rate payable at the gate to reduce bumping from overbooking.#apr.43.2
e,Yes finally I have been doing this flying to and from for three years.#apr.44.0
u,This is one of the best things that DOT has done in the past three months.#apr.44.1
e,I was stuck on a flight for three hours on the tarmac while it was thunder and lighting just sitting.#apr.44.2
u,Why now finally something has been done.#apr.44.3
u,So little so late for me.#apr.44.4
u,But I guess it better late than never.#apr.44.5
u,This alone would put a huge dent in the UNFAIR practice of bumping passengers who expect the airline to get them to their destination in time and on the right flight.#apr.45.0
u,It is very inconvenient to have to contact friends and family at your destination that you will be arriving late or not at all because you were bumped.#apr.45.1
u,Friends and family on many ocassions have taken time off to meet you.#apr.45.2
n,A previous comment stated that airlines are private companies and should not be micro-managed.#apr.49.0
u,I do not want to be stuck on the tarmac or at the gate for more than 2 hours without the option of de-planing.#apr.49.1
u,I want to be able to choose another flight, drive to my destination, or come back another day.#apr.49.2
u,I do not want to feel like a prisoner of the "private airline companies".#apr.49.3
u,DOT should require the airlines to build valid contingency plans and include them along with their application for right of carriage.#apr.49.4
u,Right of carriage does NOT include RIGHT of INCARCERATION!#apr.49.5
u,I have an issue with airlines changing my flight after I booked, and leave me no recourse.#apr.51.0
e,I booked a flight in November from Orlando to Texas to CA.#apr.51.1
e,The airline decided to cancel my flight and book me through Boston instead.#apr.51.2
e,There was no offer of a refund,#apr.51.3
u,but they were able to put me through JFK - not much better.#apr.51.4
u,Passengers should be offered an automatic full refund in this situation.#apr.51.5
e,It has happened 3 or 4 times to me - and not always the same airline.#apr.51.6
u,All the problems described in this survey are due to the fact that, in reality, there is minimal competition in the air transportation field in this country.#apr.999.0
u,The cabotage regulations, promulgated at the infancy of the industry to protect US carriers from foreign competition guarantee that the airlines can inflict anything on the public without fear that their clients, who most times have only one or two other carriers flying from one city to another, can go to a competitor.#apr.999.1
u,This anti-competitive environment might have been needed years ago.#apr.999.2
u,In the 21st century it is time to allow competition from foreign airlines, that already have flights to practically most US cities to carry passengers from, at least their first gateway city withing the US to their final destination.#apr.999.3
u,This way, the most congested routes, for example Miami to New York City, or New York to San Fransisco, will have plenty of flights available to prospective passengers.#apr.999.4
n,Foreign airlines already fly between those cities, most times half or three quarters empty.#apr.999.5
u,Let us utilize these empty seats at a logical price without being subjected to the whims of the US airline monopoly.#apr.999.6
u,There should definitely be a cap and not this hideous amount between $800 and $1200.#apr.221.0
u,$400 is enough compensation and is probably a fair average of a one-way fare.#apr.221.1
e,I checked in a passenger on a $98.00 fare from east coast to Las Vegas the other day;#apr.221.2
u,I hardly think he should get $800 or up to $1200 to "compensate" him if he were bumped.#apr.221.3
e,My child is 2 years old and he is severely allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, egg and milk.#apr.488.0
e,My son has reacted to airborne particles from someone opening a bag of nuts near him.#apr.488.1
e,My husband and I used to be world traveler's and dreamed of traveling with our son.#apr.488.2
u,It is heart-breaking to think that our child will not get to experience the world,#apr.488.3
e,or if he does it may cost him his life.#apr.488.4
u,This is a disability, no question about it.#apr.488.5
u,We are talking about being in the air with peanut particles being circulated through the cabin and possible no place to land for hours.#apr.488.6
n,An Epi-Pen only last 15 minutes.#apr.488.7
u,Peanut allergy is unpredictable.#apr.488.8
n,The first reaction could be mild and the second could cause your blood pressure to drop like a rocket, your throat to close up and your heart to stop beating.#apr.488.9
e,Yes, we carry Epi-pens everywhere we go,#apr.488.10
u,but even 10 wouldn't be enough on an airplane.#apr.488.11
u,I know that airplane or not you could be somewhere where peanuts are opened.#apr.488.12
u,The point is, you can't leave an airplane and get away from the peanut dust.#apr.488.13
u,You can leave other areas and get away from it.#apr.488.14
u,Also, we do not chose to be anywhere we know there will be a lot of people eating peanuts, like ball games or restaurants that have them on the floor of their establishments.#apr.488.15
u,It's not going to cost you your job if you choose not to go to a ball game or certain restaurant.#apr.488.16
u,It will if you keep refusing to travel and the job requires that.#apr.488.17
e,I don't know anyone who will DIE if they don't have peanuts or peanut dust,#apr.488.18
e,but I know plenty of people who would DIE if they do have peanuts or breathe in peanut dust.#apr.488.19
u,I support a ban on all peanuts and peanut products on airplanes and an announcement to all passengers asking them to refrain from eating peanut products during the flight.#apr.488.20
u,Compensation should be kept with a dollar amount basis,#apr.224.0
n,as the amount of the fare may not be suitable to cover expenses, such as food or lodging.#apr.224.1
u,Smaller aircraft do need compensation,#apr.224.2
u,however it should be based on what the alternative travel options are.#apr.224.3
u,Typically, a smaller connecting flight will be either close to home, or close to the destination,#apr.224.4
u,where the traveler may want to opt for a rental car or taxi instead.#apr.224.5
u,Zero-fare tickets may not need monetary compensation,#apr.224.6
n,as they did not pay out of pocket for the flight,#apr.224.7
u,but in addition to being re-booked, the miles or points redeemed should be credited back to the account.#apr.224.8
u,It would not be fair for people using zero-fare tickets to walk out with cash-in-hand.#apr.224.9
u,The biggest issue with overbooking is that people are not informed of their options.#apr.224.10
u,The full flight information is not disclosed when the "next flight" time is given.#apr.224.11
u,I would like to see a printed overbooking or bumping policy at the agent counter available, as well as the agents being up front with the customers when asking for volunteers, such as, "We are overbooked by 7 passengers. We are looking for volunteers, etc..."#apr.224.12
e,My recent experience with an overbooking, they were looking for volunteers,#apr.224.13
u,and I hesitated#apr.224.14
e,because I saw a few people already list their names.#apr.224.15
u,I did not know if they needed more.#apr.224.16
e,Also, they only announced that the next flight was just over an hour later.#apr.224.17
e,They did not mention the fact that the flight was not nonstop like the one we were listed on, but with a 5 hour layover.#apr.224.18
u,Taxes and fees collected along with non-refundable fares should be refundable.#apr.136.0
u,These are usually taxes or fees collected on behalf of the US or other governments and include such fees as border crossings, customs and agricultural inspection, taxes on ticket fares, security charges, airport use, etc.#apr.136.1
n,When a ticket is canceled, these services are not used and the governments and other public facilities entitled to the fees do not receive them.#apr.136.2
u,In effect, the airlines are stealing and pocketing money they collect on behalf of government entities!#apr.136.3
e,Our daughter is even allergic to airborne peanut dust in a plane when other people open their bag of complementary peanuts in the opposite end of the plane... gasping for air and almost choking.#apr.287.0
e,Once she told the cabin crew about her allergy at the gate AND again when she got on the plane.#apr.287.1
e,The result... they gave her a handi-towel and told her to wipe the armrests of her seat off.#apr.287.2
e,Then, then served peanuts to everyone on the plane...#apr.287.3
e,even the people sitting next to her.#apr.287.4
u,I think it's important to stress the real reason that aircraft is not returning to the gate.#apr.289.0
n,Once the aircraft pulls away from the jetway, the crew is on the clock.#apr.289.1
n,They are not being paid while sitting at a gate.#apr.289.2
u,And 3 hours is too long to keep people on a grounded airplane.#apr.289.3
e,I fly 2-4 times a year and will avoid flying if possible.#apr.820.0
e,I am allergic to all nuts.#apr.820.1
n,The allergy is airborne.#apr.820.2
e,I have had reactions to people eating nuts around me including difficulty breathing, eyes swollen shut, rash, hives.#apr.820.3
e,From consuming a mislabled product I almost died and required immediate ER care.#apr.820.4
u,When I fly, my biggest concern is the AMOUNT of nuts on the plane,#apr.820.5
n,because the more nuts, the stronger the reaction.#apr.820.6
u,If airlines could just be required to make an announcement asking people to voluntarily not consume nuts on a flight, and not be responsible for enforcing it, even that would make a difference in my ability to live through a flight.#apr.820.7
e,I only fly Jet Blue, they only serve cashews as snacks and sometimes will substitute another snack if I request in advance#apr.820.8
e,when they refuse I do not get on the plane.#apr.820.9
e,What I have started doing is handing out preprinted cards that explain my allergy.#apr.820.10
e,I pass them out at the gate as people are waiting to board.#apr.820.11
u,The vast majority of people were very open and cooperative.#apr.820.12
n,So, the majority of the plane was nut-free.#apr.820.13
e,There may have been one person who consumed nuts,#apr.820.14
e,but I did not have a reaction#apr.820.15
u,so I don't think there was.#apr.820.16
u,However, letting all the people know is better than not telling them,#apr.820.17
u,because most people are understanding and don't want to risk emergency landing.#apr.820.18
u,If the DOT just asks airlines to make that announcement, and then leave it up to passengers to comply, that would be a step in the right direction.#apr.820.19
e,I bring Lysol wipes on board every flight and clean my row off in preboarding.#apr.820.20
e,I bring two epipens, benadryl, and my health insurance info.#apr.820.21
e,I always call ahead at least twice and write down the time and date and the name of the representative I spoke with about my allergy.#apr.820.22
u,This is what many have to do in order to fly.#apr.820.23
u,Maybe DOT should mirror the same process for allergens.#apr.820.24
u,I think peanuts should be banned from planes.#apr.1068.0
u,I don't care about them one way or the other, and if it would allow someone with a peanut allergy to fly, then great!#apr.1068.1
u,I do not know of any other food allergies that can be lethal without consuming the food.#apr.924.0
n,Peanut allergy can be deadly even if a person just breathes the vapor or dust.#apr.924.1
n,On the other hand, I doubt there is anyone who will die if peanuts are not allowed on a flight.#apr.924.2
u,There are many other foods that can be consumed as a snack without endangering anyone's life.#apr.924.3
u,I know I risk upsetting pet owners,#apr.924.4
n,I believe that larger pets are still accommodated this way on most airlines.#apr.924.5
u,I have a great deal of empathy for those who have, or are related to someone who has, severe peanut allergies.#apr.460.0
u,Clearly, their health is much more important that my desire to snack on peanuts for a few hours,#apr.460.1
u,and I doubt many people could debate that.#apr.460.2
e,I was on a Southwest flight not long ago, where a mom demanded that peanuts not be served on her flight with her daughter.#apr.460.3
e,The flight attendants complied.#apr.460.4
e,Mind you, this was Southwest Airlines, which had the marketing tagline "We Fly For Peanuts" for years.#apr.460.5
u,Common sense dictates that if your daughter has a severe peanut allergy, YOU DON'T FLY SOUTHWEST.#apr.460.6
e,Even if the crew agrees to suspend peanut service for this flight, the last flight served peanuts.#apr.460.7
e,There are discarded peanut bags in the seat back pocket in front of your daughter.#apr.460.8
n,Peanut dust is on the seats, in the ventilation, and everywhere else.#apr.460.9
e,On the same flight I, and many friends of mine who also travel frequently, each had a bag of nuts in our carry-on.#apr.460.10
u,Forget for a moment that it would be impossible  for flight crew to prevent people from eating their own snacks while flying.#apr.460.11
u,The mere fact that I had an open bag of nuts in my carry-on - even if I never took it out - could have been enough to trigger this girl's allergy.#apr.460.12
u,The slippery-slope potential here boggles the mind.#apr.460.13
u,Sorry, sir, you can't board this flight.#apr.460.14
u,You will never convince peanut allergy sufferers or their families that this should not be controlled,#apr.460.15
u,and I can see their point without agreeing with it.#apr.460.16
e,I am violently allergic to dogs and cats,#apr.460.17
n,yet most mass-market airlines now allow pets to be stowed in the passenger compartment.#apr.460.18
e,I don't recall anyone ever asking me if my health would be compromised by allowing pet dander aboard.#apr.460.19
u,I don't protest,#apr.460.20
u,because I am responsible for controlling my own allergies, whether that means carrying a dust mask or an epi-pen aboard.#apr.460.21
u,If I choose to fly, I alone must be responsible for my own health.#apr.460.22
u,As much as allergens might affect me, other people have rights too; and to twist around a well-known saying, "My rights end where your nose begins."#apr.460.23
n,Travel vouchers are similarly valued at the airlines' discretion, even when a dollar value is specified.#apr.461.0
e,I was recently voluntarily bumped from a US Airways flight, after being promised that the travel voucher was good for flights with any of their codeshare partners.#apr.461.1
n,Well ... contrary to what the gate agent told me, the voucher is only good on US Airways-coded flights;#apr.461.2
e,and as I live in the Southwest,#apr.461.3
n,there's a very good chance this voucher will expire worthless.#apr.461.4
u,Good for the airlines, not so good for me.#apr.461.5
e,Because the gate agent would not give me the voucher - and let me read the fine print - until the plane had pushed back from the gate.#apr.461.6
e,I've experienced tantrums from fully grown adults#apr.804.0
e,because they were restricted in their peanut consumption in daycare environments.#apr.804.1
u,I'd rather not have this experience on a flight.#apr.804.2
u,My daughter will only fly on peanut-free planes#apr.804.3
u,if peanut is on the ingredients list, the item should be banned.#apr.804.4
u,Made in a peanut facility is fine and the allergic individual should know not to consume the item.#apr.804.5
u,As far as I understand it, highly processed peanut oil is safe.#apr.804.6
u,Didn't think so.#apr.550.0
u,Most food allergies are imagined.#apr.550.1
u,You clearly have a financial interest in promoting the myth of food allergy.#apr.550.2
u,If someone is actually that allergic, they should stay home and not inconvenience the rest of us.#apr.550.3
u,You are right on sir!#apr.551.0
u,Most of these supposed allergies are the paranoid imaginings of over anxious parents.#apr.551.1
u,The rest of the public should not be forced to accommodate them.#apr.551.2
u,A hive or two is not going to kill little jimmy,#apr.551.3
u,and the previous poster "shoeslut" should have her head examined for panicking like that.#apr.551.4
u,She is causing more harm to her child by being such a paranoid freak than any peanut ever will.#apr.551.5
u,Finally the voice of reason.#apr.554.0
u,While I still dispute whether your reaction will be as severe as you believe,#apr.554.1
u,at least you realize that it is your responsibility to take precautions.#apr.554.2
u,Your ailment is not shared by the general population,#apr.554.3
u,and should not be an excuse to infringe upon the rights of others.#apr.554.4
u,first off, you do not have a 'fatal' peanut allergy - you are still alive.#apr.556.0
u,MAYBE you have a 'potentially fatal' allergy - extremely unlikely, but possible.#apr.556.1
u,Your only viable solution - DON'T FLY.#apr.556.2
u,Absolutely correct.#apr.557.0
u,Allergies are largely the realm of the hypochondriac.#apr.557.1
u,Get a real doctor to diagnose this - not an 'allergist' as they have an agenda to promote.#apr.557.2
u,These peanut people are just a new kind of PC nazi.#apr.557.3
u,If you really have a problem, DON'T FLY!#apr.557.4
u,What is hard to believe is that you feel perfectly fine inflicting your unfounded paranoia on the rest of us.#apr.559.0
n,Truly life threatening food allergies are vanishingly rare.#apr.559.1
u,These days everyone seems to want to think they belong to a special needs group of some kind.#apr.559.2
u,You got a hive once after eating a peanut butter sandwich,#apr.559.3
u,and suddenly you have a life threatening allergy.#apr.559.4
u,If you are one of the VERY FEW who actually have this condition, DON'T FLY.#apr.559.5
u,You can't go to a job interview anyway,#apr.559.6
n,because anywhere you go you will be exposed to peanuts.#apr.559.7
u,'Most' schools are not succumbing to this foolish paranoia - just the ones run by PC nazi whackos.#apr.559.8
u,I tell you what, anyone tells me I can't feed my kid the one nutritious snack she will actually eat better be prepared for a lawsuit and a black eye.#apr.559.9
u,Absolutely correct.#apr.562.0
u,Unfounded fear is paralyzing this country and taking the enjoyment of life away from an entire generation of children.#apr.562.1
n,Far less that 1% of the population actually has a severe allergy.#apr.562.2
n,99% of those who think they do are full of it.#apr.562.3
u,Oh yeah, the kid had a reaction at 3yrs. old.#apr.562.4
u,It is almost certain that by 5yrs. he will have outgrown the sensitivity.#apr.562.5
u,How about ZERO.#apr.563.0
u,This is a non-issue.#apr.563.1
u,Peanuts are harmless.#apr.563.2
u,Methinks you have an agenda.#apr.564.0
u,Highly suspicious that the child of a physician who is hyper aware of bad things that can happen coincidentally has not one, but three life threatening allergies.#apr.564.1
u,Food allergies have to be the most overblown imagined health problem of our time.#apr.564.2
u,Hypochondriacs all.#apr.564.3
u,I sincerely doubt you "know plenty of people who will die if they do have peanuts or breathe in peanut dust".#apr.565.0
u,Almost no-one is actually that allergic.#apr.565.1
u,Lot's of people think they are much worse off than they really are.#apr.565.2
u,While notifying customers of delays as soon as is feasibly possible is an admirable goal,#apr.26.0
u,I wonder if delays of 30 minutes would actually affect passenger behavior.#apr.26.1
e,In my experience it usually takes about 30 minutes to get to major airports,#apr.26.2
u,in which case, killing 30 minutes at home or at the airport makes little difference - especially when security lines make you leave way earlier than your expected flight.#apr.26.3
u,Maybe it would be a better use of the airlines resources to focus efforts on notifying passengers of delays that are 2 hours or more as soon as possible.#apr.26.4
n,One way DOT could help inform passengers of bumping process and compensation for voluntary  bumping is through the use of gate television screens.#apr.27.0
n,For example, at United Airline's hub locations, they have television screens which clearly show the standby list, your place on the standby list, and how many have checked in.#apr.27.1
u,Adding another screen to televisions like this that indicate bumping may be an easy and effective way of implementing DOT's new rule.#apr.27.2
u,Often in these situations there is a long line of people in similar positions or who need different kinds of help.#apr.28.0
u,Requiring the gate agent to recite a litany of conditions will probably just delay flights more.#apr.28.1
n,People can read the fine print;#apr.28.2
u,if they don't, that's their problem#apr.28.3
u,and they should deal with the consequences.#apr.28.4
u,I am definitely in favor of requiring airlines to list the total price upfront.#apr.29.0
u,Often I think I have a great deal, but then discover that it's not so great after all when the taxes and fees add up to almost as much as the ticket itself.#apr.29.1
u,It might be good for airlines to be required to itemize the taxes and fees too,#apr.29.2
u,since I never have any clue what they cover.#apr.29.3
u,The DOT should require this type of disclosure too.#apr.29.4
u,I am not sure how this may fit in here,#apr.31.0
u,but there needs to be greater regulation of carry-on items across all airports.#apr.31.1
u,At some, passengers can get away with bringing luggage on that would be checked-in at other airports.#apr.31.2
n,Additionally, gate agents do not enforce carry-on bag regulations in terms of size and number.#apr.31.3
u,This is a huge pain for other passengers#apr.31.4
n,who then cannot find a place for their bags#apr.31.5
n,because one person has taken up an entire overhead bin.#apr.31.6
u,While I don't advocate making people pay more fees,#apr.31.7
u,I think that if passengers are found to have bags that are too big to carry-on at the gate, they should at least pay a partial fee to check them on like everyone else who paid to check their bags on.#apr.31.8
u,However, if passengers are forced to check their carry-ons due to limited overhead space, then there should be no fees for them.#apr.31.9
u,ALL flights should be covered --#apr.59.0
u,it's no more tolerable being trapped on the tarmac at a small airport than at at large one!#apr.59.1
u,Nor any difference if it's a domestic or international flight!#apr.59.2
u,The passenger experience is the same!#apr.59.3
u,Yes, ALL these DOT proposals should be enacted.#apr.61.0
u,1 Advertised prices should reflicct the ENTIRE price that must be paid.#apr.62.0
u,2 Optional services should be opt-in#apr.62.1
u,3 Post-purchase increases should be permitted only if the purchaser is permitted to cance or change plans without penalty.#apr.62.2
u,The problems with passenger experience are not dependant on aircraft size!#apr.64.0
u,The buffer zone solution would not give me any confidence.#apr.67.0
e,The time that my daughter had a reaction it was right after visiting the restroom.#apr.67.1
n,In a buffer zone situation the person could still be exposed to peanut residue in other parts of the plane .#apr.67.2
e,Now we carry wipes and wipe down every surface in our seating area and in the restroom when we fly an airline like southwest that serves peanuts on previous flights even if they aren't serving it on ours.#apr.67.3
u,I would like to see the airlines stop serving peanuts.#apr.71.0
u,Having them not serve peanuts when my children are going to be on a particular flight doesn't do much for us.#apr.71.1
u,If they have served 200 people 200 little bags of peanuts on the 200 previous flights.... - it makes my skin crawl.#apr.71.2
u,We can live with them serving other foods that "may" contain peanuts.#apr.71.3
u,It would be nice if they at least had one "safe" alternative for my children to eat -#apr.71.4
u,or allow them to bring safe food of their own on the plane with them.#apr.71.5
u,As for the "slippery slope" argument - I don't buy it.#apr.71.6
u,I've never heard of anyone having a wheat allergy going into anaphylaxis from some one sitting next to them eating a sandwich.#apr.71.7
n,People with food allergies have reactions when they INJEST food.#apr.71.8
u,The issue with peanuts is that when 200 people open 200 little bags of nuts and all the dust goes Poof!#apr.71.9
n,There is enough peanut dust in the air for some one  to actually injest the allergen.#apr.71.10
u,As for meds - everyone that has a true life threatening food allergy should be carrying their own epi-pens with them.#apr.71.11
u,I wouldn't think that the airlines are going to want to get into the hassle of giving passengers medicine.#apr.71.12
e,I would like to mention though that on the last flight I was on with my children we payed quite a bit of money on a "snack box" that didn't have the ingredients labeled on the outside of the box, only to find that most of the food in the box was not safe for my kids to eat.#apr.71.13
u,A list of ingredients should always be available to us before we have to pay for food.#apr.71.14
u,Advanced notification would help to possibly get another flight.#apr.76.0
u,In a perfect world they would sell the number of seats they have.#apr.76.1
u,When in US airspace, DOT rules should apply to all carriers, regardless of the number of aircraft seats or nationality.#apr.85.0
u,Without details regarding the methodology of this cost-benefit analysis, it is difficult to comment on the 'reasonableness' of what is proposed.#apr.86.0
u,Disclosure of fees to the consumer should not have a quantifiable cost.#apr.86.1
e,I have one child who is severely allergic to peanuts.#apr.87.0
e,She is one of those few who react from dust, practically.#apr.87.1
e,We made a decision at an early age simply not to fly.#apr.87.2
n,The airlines have no cohesive, consistent policy#apr.87.3
u,and this issue is not something we can show up and be surprised about.#apr.87.4
u,It would help children, and adults, like my daughter if the DOT banned peanuts on all flights.#apr.87.5
u,Of course, asking airlines to stop serving peanuts is not enough.#apr.87.6
u,The DOT would need to require that no passenger bring them aboard as well.#apr.87.7
n,cuts to the airlines have put food at the bottom of their priority list .#apr.87.8
u,I almost feel like banning peanuts would give people a false sense of security UNLESS a complete and total ban was instituted .#apr.87.9
u,That being said, I appreciate the argument about other allergies, as well as perfume#apr.87.10
n,though I do not believe anaphylaxis is generally an issue for those allergic to perfume.#apr.87.11
u,Perhaps that is a bit naive and narrow-minded,#apr.87.12
u,Propose that to the airlines as a cost saving measure!#apr.87.13
u,Of course, longer flights or international is a whole other ballgame.#apr.87.14
n,*  From empirical evidence, I believe there is a strong likelihood of a peanut allergy sufferer having a severe reaction if the conditions were right.#apr.87.15
e,My daughter developed hives from peanut shell residue that had touched a banana peel.#apr.87.16
e,She touched the peel to her skin and broke out in hives.#apr.87.17
u,It doesn't take much.#apr.87.18
u,*  I feel strongly that people should take responsibility for themselves and, therefore, would expect all allergy sufferers to carry their own epinephrine.#apr.87.19
u,However, I am under the assumption that a plane would have first aid available and possibly a defibrillator.#apr.87.20
u,Adding epinephrine to this kit would only be a good business practice.#apr.87.21
u,*  I would feel  safe on a plane where peanut-ingredient products are banned from airline and passengers, but "may contains" were permitted.#apr.87.22
e,My allergic daughter would not consume them,#apr.87.23
u,but the chance of her having a reaction from cross contact or inhalation are virtually nil.#apr.87.24
u,Again, it's about personal responsibility.#apr.87.25
e,We will take care of her food.#apr.87.26
u,We just need help keeping her alive and safe from other peoples food.#apr.87.27
u,Compensation must be in fiat currency.#apr.89.0
n,Frequent flier miles and certificates offered as compensation are valued at the discretion of the airlines.#apr.89.1
n,Few if any airlines offer peanuts anymore.#apr.90.0
n,But peanuts are not the only allergen-#apr.90.1
n,More people are allergic to pets than peanuts.#apr.90.2
u,Airlines should disclose potential allergens on a flight .#apr.92.0
u,First, I congratulate and thank Secretary LaHood and DOT for their efforts in improving customer protections for travelers.#apr.97.0
u,The cut-off should be for all types of planes, not just large ones.#apr.97.1
u,Airports AND carriers should work together to develop tarmac contingency plans.#apr.97.2
u,Personally, I think 3 hours is too long to be held captive in a immobile plane.#apr.97.3
u,Two hours is much more reasonable.#apr.97.4
u,I agree - it's be wise to disclose potential allergens.#apr.98.0
n,I agree, r88c, there are more allergens than just peanuts#apr.98.1
e,my family has a few beyond peanuts in our own list.#apr.98.2
n,However, there's a difference between my cat allergy  and my daughter's peanut, tree nut and shellfish allergies - threat of anaphylaxis, vomiting, swelling of lips, itching in the mouth, etc.#apr.98.3
n,Any food allergen  can trigger life threatening reactions -#apr.98.4
n,BUT, peanuts and tree nuts combine for the top cause of ER visits for treatment of life threatening symptoms each year.#apr.98.5
n,WHole peanuts or nuts are also more apt to release dust particles through the air system, then, say, opening a milk carton.#apr.98.6
u,no#apr.98.7
u,but it is a start.#apr.98.8
e,As a mother of a peanut allergic child,#apr.98.9
u,I won't fly with her on flights that serve peanuts.#apr.98.10
u,I won't fly with her if i can't have her EpiPen with her in flight.#apr.98.11
u,Consumers should be notified about delays, no matter how long they are.#apr.100.0
u,This can be done electronically very easily.#apr.100.1
u,If the flight is late and making a connecting flight is not possible, then the consumer should be afforded the opportunity to alter plans as soon as possible.#apr.100.2
u,I think it is important that both domestic and international flights be covered by this requirement.#apr.100.3
u,Giving the consumer's more information regarding pricing schemes is definitely helpful for those who travel on a budget.#apr.103.0
u,I think that post-purchase price increases should be banned.#apr.103.1
u,If a compromise must be reached, then any consumer must be allowed to refund their ticket if prices are increased--even if the ticket was non-refundable.#apr.103.2
u,Trapping consumers like this is horrible and quite unethical.#apr.103.3
u,Airlines should absolutely reimburse passengers whose bags are not delivered on time or lost.#apr.106.0
u,A time period must be specified--#apr.106.1
u,it cannot be left for the airlines to decide.#apr.106.2
u,Yes, carriers should refund ticket costs for significant delays.#apr.106.3
u,Actually, they should give consumers the choice between a refund or some other form of compensation for those travelers who decide their time has become too short for travel due to the delay and change their travel plans.#apr.106.4
u,Significant delay must also be defined by DOT.#apr.106.5
u,It's too bad that this industry has become so anti-consumerist.#apr.106.6
u,Self-regulation has not worked and the consumers have carried a significant burden because of it.#apr.106.7
u,I don't know that I would feel safe flying without a total ban.#apr.118.0
u,There are too many variables.#apr.118.1
u,Realistically, I know that a total ban is unlikely.#apr.118.2
u,For most people, an airline ban, a buffer zone, epinephrine in a first aid kit, and pre-boarding would probably go a long way to making them comfortable.#apr.118.3
u,But, like I said, it probably would not be enough for me and mine.#apr.118.4
u,I've also heard in the past of some airlines forcing passengers to sign statements acknowledging that they will not stop the flight and seek assistance if an allergic reaction happens.#apr.118.5
e,I think it was American Airlines and I read the actual documents.#apr.118.6
u,Obviously, this practice is incredibly paralyzing.#apr.118.7
n,Last I knew, medical emergencies in the form of heart attacks and pre-mature labor are handled on a case by case basis#apr.118.8
n,and it is not unheard of to land a plane early.#apr.118.9
n,AA made the allergic community an exception to this practice.#apr.118.10
u,Though our comfort zone is very tight,#apr.118.11
u,I do appreciate that the DOT is trying to reach a compromise with the allergic and non-allergic passengers.#apr.118.12
u,For many people, minor changes to the system will go a long way.#apr.118.13
u,I think red eye is correct:#apr.122.0
u,DOT is on a slippery slope if it bans peanuts.#apr.122.1
u,However, I also understand the concerns of people with severe peanut allergies.#apr.122.2
u,Perhaps airlines could offer only select flights as "Peanut-Free" instead of a complete ban on peanuts.#apr.122.3
u,I have to say I think this is going too far.#apr.128.0
u,You can't legislate everything.#apr.128.1
e,I have to say I've never seen such a thing on the news.#apr.128.2
u,No perfume, because people are allergic to that.#apr.128.3
u,No deodorant, because some are allergic to that.#apr.128.4
u,Oh, and make  sure you wear all cotton#apr.128.5
n,because you might bump up against someone with a skin allergy to synthetic fiber.#apr.128.6
u,It can quickly slide into ridiculous.#apr.128.7
u,I'm sorry for those who have allergies,#apr.128.8
u,but those people also live with them daily and know how to cope and deal with them in public.#apr.128.9
n,All the baggage fee has done is force people to take more as carry-ons, causing loading delays of all sorts.#apr.129.0
u,Between the security  and the baggage fees pretty soon you won't be able to take anything with you at all.#apr.129.1
u,The cost of the ticket is already ridiculously high.#apr.129.2
u,Instead of charging us, perhaps they need to bring in consultants and auditors to see just where their money is going#apr.129.3
u,and see how they can be more efficient with the money they are already extorting.#apr.129.4
n,I've actually found it's now cheaper to ship my items Fed Ex than it is to bring them with me on the plane.#apr.129.5
e,AND they get there! On time!#apr.129.6
u,I totally agree if the airline loses the luggage or it's delayed they should have to refund the fee they charged.#apr.129.7
u,They did not provide the service you paid for, end of story.#apr.129.8
u,I completely agree ALL the fees should be listed when you buy that ticket.#apr.129.9
u,Prominently. You should know what you are going to be asked to pay for.#apr.129.10
u,I have to say personally that if they start charging me a fee for putting a small bag in the overhead bin I will no longer be a customer.#apr.129.11
u,I will not fly any airline that does something so ridiculous.#apr.129.12
u,No, that's where I draw the line.#apr.129.13
u,I'll drive#apr.129.14
u,Agree with mezo.#apr.131.0

u,If a person with very severe allergies boards a plane and allerts them ahead of time of their allergy, then keep the peanuts off the flight.#apr.140.4
n,This would apply to all kinds of allergies.#apr.140.5
e,As a flight attendant of 19and years, we never had peanut allergies in the earlier days,#apr.142.0

u,While I am sympathetic to those with this condition,#apr.146.1
u,It is the TOTAL RESPONSIBILITY of the parent or adult to adequately prepare for the possibility of being exposed to an allergen.#apr.146.2
u,Airlines have enough to worry about without all of these over-the-top issues.#apr.146.3
u,It's time for MORE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY and FAR LESS government nannying.#apr.146.4
u,Once purchased, ticket prices should be guaranteed.#apr.148.0

n,Since your airline continues to serve peanuts,#apr.153.1

e,My child with a severe nut and peanut allergy had a reaction on a domestic flight.#apr.155.0
e,Luckily her breathing was not compromised#apr.155.1
e,but she broke out in hives across her entire body.#apr.155.2
u,I was very very close to using epi-pens on this flight and had all the flight attendants hovering around us.#apr.155.3
e,She only ate the safe food we brought onto the flight - nothing from the airline.#apr.155.4
e,I also wiped down our seating area before she boarded.#apr.155.5
e,However, she is very touch-sensitive#apr.155.6
u,and the seats are hard to clean#apr.155.7
n,as they are made of fabric.#apr.155.8
e,For the flight home we brought a sheet to cover the seats#apr.155.9
u,and she did not react the same way but did get a hive or two none-the-less.#apr.155.10
u,Peanut-residue is very hard to remove from fabric surfaces.#apr.155.11
u,I would love to see a ban on having loose peanuts on flights -#apr.155.12
u,food like Snickers that contain nuts are ok from my perspective.#apr.155.13
u,I agree with many others that even 3 hours is too long..#apr.157.0
u,I think it should be 2 and should apply to all flights regardless of what airport, airline, destination, etc.#apr.157.1
u,People are people no matter where they are and should not be subjected to being miserable after paying a fee to fly somewhere!#apr.157.2
u,Personally I have anxiety issues#apr.157.3
u,and not being able to get out of an enclosed space is extremely stressful.#apr.157.4
u,I think the airlines will now be forced to do all they can to prevent these delays.#apr.157.5
u,Even though all will not be possible to prevent#apr.157.6
u,I think there will be much less episodes wtih these new rules.#apr.157.7
u,As far as notification as to what is happening--I think it goes a LONG ways to alleviate frustration if we were informed in detail every 30 minutes.#apr.157.8
e,I have been stranded on a plane 3 times--thankfully not more than 1 1 or 2 hours--#apr.157.9
e,but on one of these flights we were informed regularly along the way#apr.157.10
u,and it made all the difference.#apr.157.11
u,List all fees seperately.#apr.158.0
u,I agree--ALL fees should be prominently displayed wherever you are making the purchase.#apr.159.0
u,And there should not be a limit on how long changes are posted--many people are not frequent flyers and whether you fly once a year or every week you should know exactly what you will pay.#apr.159.1
e,I fly fairly often on a 2 hr flight to see family.#apr.159.2
e,Since the inception of baggage fees I do not check any bags--#apr.159.3
e,I carry on a regulation carry-on for the bin and a fairly large purse bag that DOES fit comfortably under my seat.#apr.159.4
u,I feel that as long as your carry-ons meet one regulation size in bin and one that fits comfortably under your seat that should be fine--#apr.159.5
u,and the airlines need to describe what is allowed that way.#apr.159.6
e,I am on a limited budget#apr.159.7
u,and the $30-$60 fee for bags is better spent having fun with my grandson.#apr.159.8
u,If they start charging for carry-ons as I have described then I will quit flying.#apr.159.9
u,I think it has gotten to the point of ridiculous how these petty fees are charged for everything--#apr.159.10
u,it certtainly does not give the customer a warm fuzzy feeling toward the industry.#apr.159.11
u,Everyone I know now hates to fly.#apr.159.12
u,POST FEES FOR EVERYTHING prominently.#apr.159.13
u,Should be required of all carriers.#apr.160.0
u,I have found I am adequately notified before I leave home if a flight is known to be delayed or canceled that far in advance.#apr.164.0
e,I check the flight status on the airline website just prior to leaving home--#apr.164.1
e,additionally my airline sends me a text and an email for delays.#apr.164.2
u,My concern is the flights that get delayed or cancelled later such as after you have arrived at the airport.#apr.164.3
u,In these cases notification should be immediate--#apr.164.4
u,and every effort to get you on your way should be made--whether it is 30 minute updates for a delay--or getting you on another flight if is a cancellation.#apr.164.5
u,If you need to rebook due to no fault of your own--the flight is canceled, etc. there should be no or very minimal fees to rebook you for another flight.#apr.164.6
u,My experience has been the airlines need to do all in their power to get you on your way in the most expedient way possible AND to CARE.#apr.164.7
u,Delays and cancellations cannot always be helped and are part of everyday business for airlines#apr.164.8
u,but when a consumer misses an entire day of a vacation and or or planned time with family that cannot be given back!!#apr.164.9
u,This is more than money.#apr.164.10
e,Twice my flights wer delayed by several hours#apr.164.11
e,because after boarding it was discovered a lavatory was not in working order#apr.164.12
u,I get passionate about not being treated well--especially when airline travel is expensive for most passengers.#apr.164.13
u,Make the compensation exactly what it is intended to be...the cost  of the ticket, no cap#apr.168.0
n,since there is no cap on how much you may pay for that ticket.#apr.168.1
u,Frequent flyer miles should simply be refunded or a double amount refunded in the same way as a cash ticket is handled.#apr.168.2
u,Keep this simple and it will work much better.#apr.168.3
u,On smaller flights, use the same rules.#apr.168.4
u,Again, keep it simple.#apr.168.5
u,Best way to give passengers information is to post it online, on a legible sign in the gate area, and in print large enough to read on tickets.#apr.168.6
u,If people won't take the time to read at least one of those sources then they only have themselves to blame for not knowing about this.#apr.168.7
u,A regulation that will force the air carriers to prominently display the various fees that are required is a good idea so that you know before you fly just how much more your ticket really is going to cost .#apr.171.0
u,Optional price for a meal or entertainment is "nice to know" information#apr.171.1
u,but I don't think it needs to be written as a regulation#apr.171.2
n,since you have the option of not watching a movie#apr.171.3
n,but you likely don't have the option of not bringing that suitcase along.#apr.171.4
u,The website notification is a good idea#apr.171.5
u,but it would also be good to have these posted in the check-in area as well.#apr.171.6
u,The idea of a full fair price with every optional cost added in is not realistic#apr.171.7
n,since the majority of people do not use ALL of the options.#apr.171.8
u,I do like the add-on services idea.#apr.171.9
u,It's not the job of the airlines however to tell you that their competition may have a cheaper flight for you.#apr.171.10
u,Sorry, that's the consumer's job.#apr.171.11
u,If one airline charges significantly more for something than another airline does and it affects the competitiveness of their tickets the market will deal with that,#apr.171.12
u,no regulation for this is needed.#apr.171.13
u,Airlines should be required not only to notify passengers to changes in their itinerary, but to offer the passenger a chance to refuse the change being made and re-schedule the flight to meet their travel needs.#apr.173.0
u,It is absolutely unfair of the airline to mandate that I accept a change to my flight departure time that now conflicts with the purpose or timelines of my trip without offering me an option to say "no thanks, I chose a 2 pm departure for a very specific reason, please offer me another option that doesn't disrupt my plans".#apr.173.1
u,There should be no "change fee" charged to the consumer who turns down the airline's change to their itinerary and opts to re-book the flight.#apr.173.2
u,Way back in January I booked a flight to NC with very specific choices made to ensure that I had enough time between flights and that I arrived within a certain window of time.#apr.173.3
u,The airline proceeded to change my itinerary on three separate occasions, ultimately putting me on the flights I had specifically avoided when I booked the ticket.#apr.173.4
u,When I called to ask if I could re-book to meet my travel needs, I was told that the airline would charge me a change fee of "at least" $180, plus the difference in ticket price on that day.#apr.173.5
u,This is absurd.#apr.173.6
u,In any other industry I don't have to put up with the retailer replacing my apple with an orange and then telling me, if you *really* want the apple, you have to pay us more for it.#apr.173.7
u,No, no, no! If you have an allergy to peanuts and you know you have it then take your own precautions.#apr.174.0
u,If I decide to bring a bag of peanuts onboard an airplane and am then told I'm in a "peanut free zone" or something like that, then my rights have been trampled as have the rights of everyone in that zone.#apr.174.1
u,Request peanut free services from the airlines for yourself,#apr.174.2
u,but do not force those restrictions on the rest of the flying public.#apr.174.3
u,I have no problem with the airline offering peanut free foods, etc.#apr.174.4
u,but it should be an option that people can select not a requirement for everyone else to abide by.#apr.174.5
u,It is not a "right" if you have to impose that behavior on others for yourself.#apr.174.6
n,There is a non-profit organization called the food allergy network#apr.180.0
n,their web site is foodallergy.org.#apr.180.1
u,This site will give you some insight into the peanut allergy issue.#apr.180.2
e,My son now ten years old has a very severe peanut allergy.#apr.180.3
e,Some of the things most kids take for granted are not available to him due to the allergy.#apr.180.4
e,He cannot go to a professional baseball game for one.#apr.180.5
u,We also have to plan our vacations the locations that peanut free airlines to.#apr.180.6
u,The common misconception is "just don't eat peanuts!"#apr.180.7
u,It would be nice if it were that simple.#apr.180.8
u,The confined space and recycling of the air in a plane is a peanut allergy sufferers nightmare.#apr.180.9
n,When people eat peanuts or open up bags of preanuts some of the allergens are released into the air.#apr.180.10
n,Therefore the allergic person can be affected without physically eating the peanuts.#apr.180.11
n,The air becomes toxic to them.#apr.180.12
e,For my son this is a not just discomfort it could kill him.#apr.180.13
u,To clarify, the best action, in my opinion, for the DOT to take in regards to this matter is to completely ban post-purchase price increases#apr.182.0
n,Peanut dust can trigger allergic reactions.#apr.188.0
u,Three hours is too long to wait on the tarmac.#apr.193.0
u,The rules should be uniform regarless of the size of the plan or airport.#apr.193.1
u,After an hour or so, sitting in a plane becomes unbearable.#apr.193.2
u,The maximum time allowed should be two hours with deplaning an option.#apr.193.3
u,Boarding passes can be re-used or re-issued for access  back onto the plan.#apr.193.4
u,The proposed compensation for bumping should be such, that ailine companies would be motivated to keep on average 1 to 2 seats on any flight unoccupied - for other bumped passengers or emergency personnel to use.#apr.198.0
u,The compensation should, however, at least cover all consequential expences of the traveller besides fare.#apr.198.1
u,This way, a passenger will have maximum compensation that would still allow airline not raise fares because of this rule.#apr.198.2
u,2. The compensation should not depend on the plane size.#apr.198.3
u,3. The compensation should be the same for all tickets, zero fare or not.#apr.198.4
u,4. All compensation options, as well as compensation amounts, should be announced to passengers when asking for volunteers.#apr.198.5
u,Yes, 30 min delay is a reasonable trigger.#apr.199.0
u,Yes, 30 min response time limit is reasonable,#apr.199.1
u,but special circumstances should be included, i.e., technical issues as breakdown of comms etc.#apr.199.2
u,DOT should mention "all available methods" - that is okay.#apr.199.3
u,This rule should apply to all domestic airlines;#apr.199.4
u,foreing might be excluded.#apr.199.5
u,Yes to one way fare proposal!#apr.202.0
u,NO, no wiggle room:#apr.202.1
u,all fare prices should be as stated and final!#apr.202.2
u,All this caveats are just indended to provide sellers with means to mislead customers into thinking the fare could be smaller than it is!#apr.202.3
n,Yes, ticket sellers will incur costs to adjust the websites and selling practices;#apr.202.4
u,however, these are the costs they incurred for unfair advertizing at the moment they created their current web sites and other means of semi-deceptive sales!#apr.202.5
u,Information on the fees should appear everywhere information on ticket prices appear.#apr.204.0
u,Sum of all fees should always be listed - max and min amounts, with ability to get to all separate fees if desired.#apr.204.1
u,Full fare price should not include fees for traditionally provided services,#apr.204.2
u,but fee range for them should be indicated.#apr.204.3
u,The rules should apply to all US carriers regardless of size.#apr.204.4
u,The baggage fee for a flight should be set to the smallest one between code-sharing partners.#apr.204.5
u,Offering lowest fare available - reservations software are not all written the same.#apr.205.0
u,Convoluted solutions on unusual but valid routings exist but often defy being found.#apr.205.1
u,As a matter of practice, with availability changing constantly, it would be a near impossibility to enforce this unless software is rewritten in a consistent manner,#apr.205.2
u,plus it would have to track complete historical availability at each instant in order to enforce the rule.#apr.205.3
u,The intent is great,#apr.205.4
u,but I think unattainable and unenforceable.#apr.205.5
u,I think 3 hours is an absolute maximum that should be enforced on all planes regardless of size or airport.#apr.206.0
u,And that is ONLY when restrooms and water are provided.#apr.206.1
u,If the delay is longer than the originally scheduled flight , there should be a mechanism for obtaining food as well.#apr.206.2
e,With the state of meals and snacks on-board planes these days , I've been stuck in-flight with no food for many hours.#apr.206.3
u,If on the ground, it makes no sense to not at least have some snack.#apr.206.4
u,Full price with breakout of optional items should always be with the price - online, at ticket agents, etc.#apr.207.0
u,Code-share arrangements should be the same as those of the airline issuing the ticket.#apr.207.1
u,I think that 3 months is not long enough for many infrequent travelers.#apr.207.2
u,But if the optional  items are clearly listed upon ticket reservation or purchase, that should suffice.#apr.207.3
u,I think that separate charges for choosing your seat, having one carry on and one checked bag and access to water and restroom are nuts and should not happen.#apr.207.4
u,Snacks, blankets, OK, although these days we all look like campers getting on with pillows, extra jackets, meals , and as much carry-on as will fit.#apr.207.5
u,Counterproductive!#apr.207.6
u,Amen, this proposal goes too far.#apr.210.0
u,Freedom loving travelers don't want to be told what they can and can't bring on board the aircraft to eat.#apr.210.1
u,I know I would ignore any such ban as I currently regularly bring peanuts aboard any aircraft I am flying.#apr.210.2
u,It has become abundantly clear that commercial airline travel is a "race to the bottom" that satisfies needs of neither passengers nor airline profits.#apr.211.0
u,A change of environment, which can only be imposed from outside the industry is needed.#apr.211.1
u,Imposition of common sense regulations, such as a requirement that airlines give updated flight information, would level the playing field and remove the impetus for airlines to cost-cut in this area.#apr.211.2
u,The results would be better service to customers and a renormalization of the playing field from which the airlines compete without fear of being undercut.#apr.211.3
u,This goes for most of the proposed new regulations.#apr.211.4
u,I sincerely believe that these regulations are in the best interests of both airlines and passengers.#apr.211.5
u,I applaud the governments efforts to reign in the out of control airlines in this country.#apr.230.0
u,I am generally against government interference in business activity,#apr.230.1
u,but this is an instance where the government must step in.#apr.230.2
u,Charging fees for carry-on luggage is an example.#apr.230.3
n,The airlines have created a scenario for this to happen.#apr.230.4
u,They started by charging fees for checked luggage with little outcry.#apr.230.5
u,They knew by doing this they would create problems with carry-on luggage.#apr.230.6
u,Once the travelling public accepted the fact of checked luggage fees,the airlines could complain about the amount of luggage brought into the cabin.#apr.230.7
u,So we hear about sore backs from flight attendants, cramped space, etc.#apr.230.8
u,All of this a result of the airlines change in fees.#apr.230.9
u,Now the airlines want to explore charging for carry-on luggage.#apr.230.10
u,Before this becomes viral, even with promises by most airlines at this time not to charge for carry-on's, the government needs to explore preventing this from ever happening.#apr.230.11
n,I beleive it is part of the airlines overall plan to get to the point of charging for carry-on luggage,by highlighting the problems it created in the first place.#apr.230.12
u,I agree that the DOT's latest changes are needed,#apr.230.13
u,but we should try to prevent abusive practices from ever getting  traction in the first place.#apr.230.14
u,The airline industry in this country has shown they cannot regulate themselves.#apr.230.15
u,I generally support the idea,#apr.231.0
u,but it should be limited only to those fees which are variable, ie charge for food, etc.#apr.231.1
u,They should not be allowed to list fees separately that are part of a ticket fee for every ticket issued, ie taxes, landing fees.#apr.231.2
u,This process serves no purpose other than to show a lower base fee.#apr.231.3
u,That is misleading and meaningless.#apr.231.4
u,If they want to show these components of a ticket, so be it, but not to suggest a price which could never be exercised.#apr.231.5
u,I had no idea that peanut allergies can be so severe that proximity was enough to trigger a reaction.#apr.232.0
u,While I sympathize with the situation,#apr.232.1
u,the nature of the industry defies an easy fix.#apr.232.2
n,With the advent of "food-for-purchase" on airplanes, more and more passengers bring their own food.#apr.232.3
u,Not serving peanut products won't completely protect those who are violently allergic because of what other passengers bring on board.#apr.232.4
u,The only way I can see to ban peanuts altogether is a TSA regulation to ban it on top of an airline ban for their food service.#apr.232.5
u,This increases costs of screening and imposes new regulations on all passengers and, in turn, increases the cost of airline tickets, not to mention slowing the TSA screening lines due to increased security to check food products.#apr.232.6
u,I wish I had a creative solution to the problem.#apr.232.7
u,But, finding a practical solution will be much harder than may first appear.#apr.232.8
u,I know this sounds silly,#apr.236.0
u,but I think I shouldn't be charged as much to check a bag as the 250-lb man sitting next to me.#apr.236.1
u,I don't mind getting weighed in public...#apr.236.2
u,I don't know.#apr.244.0
u,This is just something that seems unfair to lots of passengers,#apr.244.1
u,and that probably won't get changed without regulation.#apr.244.2
u,At the very least, DOT should make clear to airlines that they *can* discriminate on the basis of weight without fearing regulatory action.#apr.244.3
u,I'm a freedom-loving, peanut-friendly traveler,#apr.245.0
u,and I have no problem with the government protecting other people from dangerous activity.#apr.245.1
n,That's the government's job.#apr.245.2
u,I agree with all the proposals.#apr.250.0
u,But with the smaller regional jets and small number of flights out of my hometown airport, bumping may not allow me to get to my destination the same day or even the next day.#apr.250.1
u,There are additional considerations here, loss of vacation time as well as paying for hotel rooms not used and rental car days.#apr.250.2
u,Any thought about how we might get away from these charges.#apr.250.3
u,Just read about a buffer zone, and the lavitories, good point,#apr.252.0
n,I also, know if Flight attendants eat these items with there hands it still would create a problem#apr.252.1
u,also, that is why no one has wanted to address this,#apr.252.2
u,that is why it is important that it is.#apr.252.3
u,How do you stop people from breing it one, and such that is ahard issue#apr.252.4
n,For flights stuck on the tarmac, they must return to an open gates.#apr.264.0
u,Open gates are sometimes difficult to find--at least in my experience.#apr.264.1
e,I fly internationally frequently#apr.264.2
e,and so I fly through major airports in the US.#apr.264.3
n,These airports have maybe 60 planes taking off an hour--and landing.#apr.264.4
u,Just an incredible number.#apr.264.5
u,Practically speaking, the airports must have extra gates available for flights that become delayed for unloading passengers.#apr.264.6
u,This could be done by either limiting the number of planes that take-off or land at the airport or providing contingent and safe ways to unload passengers--and provide them with adequate holding areas for these passengers.#apr.264.7
u,If airports share in the responsibility, they are more likely to work together with the airlines to provide such a service.#apr.264.8
u,I also think that the information about tarmac delays at individual airports  should be provided to the consumer.#apr.264.9
n,I know there are some statistics already provided,#apr.264.10
e,but I don't recall seeing any statistics on this recently.#apr.264.11
e,As a very frequent traveler,#apr.282.0
u,the biggest issue is not having updated information about flight status.#apr.282.1
u,beyond that i believe that adding all of these unnecessary burdens to airlines often of which they have no control such as weather and unexpected mechanical problems is both costly and ridiculous.#apr.282.2
u,you would think that with the economic turndown, our society would abate their temper tantrams and demanding attitudes.#apr.282.3
u,let's be civil to one another and not set unrealistic expectations--#apr.282.4
u,it costs money to accommodate your pampering and often results in unintended consequences such as the recent 3 hour tarmac limit.#apr.282.5
u,this will result in more flight cancellations.#apr.282.6
u,i wonder how many of you who complained about that and now have gotten what you asked for, will see yourselves as the cause of this ludicrous rule.#apr.282.7
u,Well said.#apr.283.0
e,I fly extensively in the US and internationally.#apr.283.1
u,And, in reading all the comments posted thus far, for the most part, there appears to be a lot of emotion and not a lot of facts surrounding this issue.#apr.283.2
u,The airlines should not be banning any food#apr.283.3
u,and they certainly should not be come the food police.#apr.283.4
u,I strongly urge the DOT to get more scientic-based information.#apr.283.5
u,Any disability needs to be treated with sensitivity.#apr.283.6
e,However, i want to point out that when we installed ramps for those in a wheel chairs, we did not remove the stairs.#apr.283.7
u,Some facts to consider.#apr.283.8
n,studies show that you cannot have a serious or deadly reaction to peanut, tree nut,  or other food allergy protein by smelling it; despite what some of the contributors here have said.#apr.283.9
n,Less than 1% of the population has a peanut allergy and not all of those are "severly" allergic.#apr.283.10
u,Compare that with the exponentially higher incidence of diabetes--#apr.283.11
n,diabetics need plant based proteins like peanuts during flights to keep their blood sugar levels under control.#apr.283.12
n,or, a milk allergy which is far more prevelent.#apr.283.13
n,Airborne exposure will not affect the body systemically, so therefore cannot cause anaphylaxis.#apr.283.14
n,If extremely allergic, you may have some symptoms like sneezing, running nose and coughing.#apr.283.15
n,For those peanut or tree nut allergic, and for all food allergies, you MUST ingest the food protein to have a systemtic reaction.#apr.283.16
n,And, even with direct skin contact to tree nuts, peanuts or peanut and nut butters, most allergic people will not show signs of a reaction,#apr.283.17
n,or it so it will be a localized minor one such as hives, or a welt.#apr.283.18
n,You can, however, have a psyhcosomatic reaction to anything you are afraid of.#apr.283.19
u,Peanut allergy has become an exaggerated fear to the detriment of those who suffer from other food allergies and other serious and chronic diseases.#apr.283.20
n,more than 3,000 kids die from asthma each year;#apr.283.21
n,10,000 kids go to the hospital each year with brain injuries due to sports;#apr.283.22
n,45,000 kids die in car accidents.#apr.283.23
e,Last time i saw a statisic on food allergy fatalities#apr.283.24
n,it was aobut 100 to 150 over a five year period for all foods.#apr.283.25
u,This is not to say that peanut and tree nut allergies, or any allergy is not serious.#apr.283.26
u,They are.#apr.283.27
u,But I wonder if these same parents who are demandting that peanuts and tree nuts be banned from everywhere are asking for sports be eliminated from school programs, or if their children are being kept out of sports. or, have they given up driving their children in a car; or, will they get their son or daughter a drivers license at age 16.#apr.283.28
u,i have a friend whose child almost died twice from a serious allergy to milk#apr.283.29
n,because people think milk allergy can't be fatal;#apr.283.30
u,they confuse milk allergy with lactose intolerance#apr.283.31
u,because the hysteria created by some about peanut has drowned out any sense of reason and overshadowed everyone else's issues.#apr.283.32
n,A recent widely publicized study showed that far more people think they have food allergies than actually do.#apr.283.33
u,Again, i am not minimizing those who do,#apr.283.34
u,but a food allergy needs to be diagnosed by a certified immunologist who conducts a food challenge.#apr.283.35
u,Then and only then does a patient really know what they are allergic to.#apr.283.36
u,and, a food allergy is very different than a food sensitivity.#apr.283.37
u,Many people have multiple food allergies,#apr.283.38
u,but once properly diagnosed that person needs to be taught to care for themselves and take all necessary precautions.#apr.283.39
u,so, let's rid ourselves of the hysteria.#apr.283.40
u,let's stop our demanding and outrageousness#apr.283.41
u,and let's call for ome common sense.#apr.283.42
u,i fear for these children that are being raised by parents to live in fear of the "bogey man".#apr.283.43
u,instead of teaching them to handle whatever afflication they have in a responsible and calm manner--whether it's severe asthma, other food allergies, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, and the hundreds of other afflications that so many of us live with everyday.#apr.283.44
e,I myself have a food allergy#apr.283.45
u,so i truly understand what it takes to be vigliant;#apr.283.46
u,it isn't easy.#apr.283.47
u,in all my years of flying and with all the different carriers i have been on, i find that whether in the US or abroad, without legislation, they try to be as accommodating as possible when people plan ahead and are not behaving rudely.#apr.283.48
u,we have more than enough regulation#apr.283.49
u,and every time a new regulation comes along it always carries unintended consequences.#apr.283.50
n,Remember, you can die from an asthma attack caused by a reaction to an animal.#apr.283.51
u,or, will you have a voice of reason and talk with the carrier, check on your medications, where a highly refined mask and take the right precautions.#apr.283.52
u,My own near fatal experience to a different allergy reinforced for me that if you demand the world conform to you, you will become lax making it more likely you will have an accidenta encounter.#apr.283.53
u,we need to be prepared and proactive, not create a bubble around ourselves and our children.#apr.283.54
u,As a frequent traveler, I would welcome the rule requiring 24 hour refundability of fares and all fees.#apr.294.0
u,Additionally, there should be a certain window, say, 3 days prior to flying where you should be able to cancel your flight without penalty and receive a refund or at least the ability to change your itinerary without fee.#apr.294.1
u,As I always say to all who will listen, the airline model is one of the worst business models I know of: treat your customers with disdain and make it as inconvenient as possible for them to use your product.#apr.294.2
u,Whether it be added fees to check luggage ;#apr.294.3
u,making it too costly to change your itinerary;#apr.294.4
u,making it virtually impossible to easily use frequent flyer miles or charging an exorbitant amount to actually use them;#apr.294.5
u,not getting timely notice when there are delays to flightsor, even worse, when a flight has been canceled;#apr.294.6
u,and lastly, being treated like cattle at the airport and on the plane.#apr.294.7
e,I have been lethally allergic to peanuts all my life,#apr.295.0
e,and while I always carry multiple Epi-pens,#apr.295.1
n,I only forty minutes to get to a hospital after using them.#apr.295.2
u,I personally would like to see a ban on peanuts and enforcing passengers to refrain from bringing banned items on board.#apr.295.3
n,But as another person pointed out, a lot of people are severely allergic to perfumes.#apr.295.4
u,I think the DOT should ask allergists the most common causes of allergic anaphylaxis, and include those in the ban.#apr.295.5
u,After all, no one NEEDS to wear perfumes or eat nuts.#apr.295.6
u,Another option I support is having no food or snacks on domestic flights.#apr.295.7
u,I think we should consider actual needs  on flights, instead of what people prefer.#apr.295.8
u,As the father of a three year old daughter who was recently diagnosed with a life-threatening peanut allergy, I fully support a ban on peanuts and food containing peanuts.#apr.298.0
e,While my daughter does not have an inhalation allergy,#apr.298.1
u,she is extremely sensitive#apr.298.2
u,and if she ingested even a minute particle of peanut protein, she could have a life threatening reaction.#apr.298.3
n,While we have epi pens and benadryl to administer in the event of such an event,#apr.298.4
u,those medications are only a short term response and immediate medical care is essential.#apr.298.5
u,As a parent, it is my job to insure she does not ingest anything that will cause a reaction#apr.298.6
u,and we do everything we can to create a large buffer between her and such products.#apr.298.7
u,That said, we have little control over the environment in an airplane.#apr.298.8
u,Others eating peanuts nearby or even someone having eaten a peanut on an earlier flight could create a very real problem.#apr.298.9
u,While we can do everything possible to clean the area in which we sit and diligently parent her while on the flight,#apr.298.10
u,the risk is significant.#apr.298.11
n,Moreover, with the number of children diagnosed with peanut allergies having tripled between 1997 and 2007  this threat is neither extremely limited nor decreasing.#apr.298.12
u,The simple fact is that a peanut allergy is life threatening and should not be compared to other intolerances or allergies that are not.#apr.298.13
u,Doing so is naive and bordering on ignorant.#apr.298.14
u,Balancing both the seriousness and scope of the threat involved against what could only be described as a petty inconvenince associated with banning peanuts and peanut products, the choice seems clear.#apr.298.15
u,That is, unless the peanut lobby or ill-informed airline passengers are making decisions in Washington.#apr.298.16
u,I commend the DOT for being on top of this issue and urge the adoption of a final rule banning peanuts and peanut products from airplans.#apr.298.17
u,I think that the fees for optional services should be clearly disclosed at the time of ticket purchace and also be clearly printed in bold, 12 point font on the ticket and ticket confirmation itself.#apr.303.0
u,You should be able to purchace a "ticket" for these optional services at the time of ticket purchace.#apr.303.1
u,If you know you will be checking in one bag, and having a meal, you should be able to easily purchace a "checked bag ticket" and a "Meal ticket" along with the flight ticket.#apr.303.2
u,These optional tickets would be required to be honored by all airlines under all circumstances.#apr.303.3
u,Travel providers should be required to display the *entire* ticket price in their advertising.#apr.304.0
u,They should not be allowed to raise the overall price with taxes, fees, etc.#apr.304.1
u,Travel providers should absolutely not be allowed to advertise a "one-way" price when a round-trip purchase is required.#apr.305.0
u,That's like a store advertising the price of one sneaker!#apr.305.1
n,Well, obviously you have to buy two sneakers#apr.305.2
u,so why would a store advertise the price for just one.#apr.305.3
u,Likewise, travel providers should clearly display the round-trip cost IF a round-trip purchase is required to obtain that fare.#apr.305.4
u,I would like to see the DOT consider regulations regarding carry-on bags in the near future.#apr.309.0
e,I don't check luggage#apr.309.1
u,so I would be against ticket prices being raised to cover one checked bag#apr.309.2
u,although I think the airlines should allow it.#apr.309.3
e,I travel with a single, legal-size backpack#apr.309.4
u,and I dread the day I have to check it because others, rather than checking oversize bags decide to carry them on and they are not stopped at either security or the gate.#apr.309.5
n,The European and Asian airlines alreasy have fairly strict rules regarding carry-on luggage,#apr.309.6
u,I'd like to see the DOT consider something similar.#apr.309.7
u,While I realize that peanut allergies can be severe,#apr.310.0
e,I'm allergic to pet dander#apr.310.1
u,and unfortunately every major airline now allows animals in the cabin -#apr.310.2
u,while I understand the necessity of service animals,#apr.310.3
e,I've also seen animals snuck aboard or allowed out of our cages.#apr.310.4
u,I'm also allergic to large amounts of perfume or scent -#apr.310.5
e,I've broken out in hives after one occasion and had no real recourse.#apr.310.6
u,The rules definitely need to be spelled out as specifically as possible and should apply to all airlines -#apr.311.0
u,I don't trust the airlines to develop and enforce their own policy.#apr.311.1
u,I agree with you Vec.#apr.314.0
e,I am severely allergic to cats#apr.314.1
e,which leads to many of the same symptoms that people with peanut allergies have tightness in the chest, the feeling of their throat closing#apr.314.2
e,for me these symptoms are made more severe#apr.314.3
e,because I also have asthma, which kicks in when I am around cats - airway constriction, uncontrollable coughing etc.#apr.314.4
n,From reading some of the post I understand that the argument has been made that peanuts should be banned because people can die of a peanut allergy.#apr.314.5
u,I also believe that animals should also be banned then#apr.314.6
n,because people who are allergic and or have asthma could also die if they are on an extended flight with an animal they are allergic to.#apr.314.7
n,According to the CDC the number of Asthma related deaths was 3,616 in 2006.#apr.314.8
e,Previous experience with getting bumped off a flight  and the airline refused to put me on another carrier's flight -#apr.316.0
e,instead I had a flight that was six hours later with absolutely no compensation.#apr.316.1
u,Basically the customer servie rep's attitude was "It's not my problem and you're using miles so we owe you nothing."#apr.316.2
u,I'm not sure how I feel about a carry-on fee.#apr.317.0
u,I would prefer to support allowing a single carry-on bag of a reasonable size  before a fee is added not counting coats, baby bags or medical eqpt -#apr.317.1
e,unfortunately I've seen purses and laptop cases that are almsot luggage sized.#apr.317.2
u,Restictions need to be enforced at check-in, near security, and at the gate.#apr.317.3
n,I thought the FAA had mandated what was allowable,#apr.317.4
u,but I have seen people allowed on with more than the 1and1 or clearly oversized bags.#apr.317.5
u,Current fees should clearly be listed on the front page of the airline's website, on itineraries printed out, and on boarding passes - especially when people check in online.#apr.317.6
e,In the interest of full disclosure, I am an allergy sufferer, mom to a child with multiple life threatening food allergies  and founder of BestAllergySites.com.#apr.330.0
u,I don't know that anyone  can say with 100% confidence whether someone might have a reaction from peanut dust.#apr.330.1
u,All individuals and allergies are different.#apr.330.2
n,An allergic reaction is an immune system response.#apr.330.3
n,If an individuals immune system is compromised, they might have a more severe reaction then they would have otherwise.#apr.330.4
n,There "have" been reactions in situations where a person is exposed to a large amount of airborne peanut protein when multiple bags of peanuts are opened at once. For instance: at a ball park.#apr.330.5
u,I only imagine a plane would be worse.#apr.330.6
e,My son had what we consider an anaphylactic reaction in flight at around the age of 2 from picking up his toy on the plane floor and then rubbing his eyes.#apr.330.7
e,His eyes immediately swelled,#apr.330.8
e,he started coughing and crying.#apr.330.9
e,Hives developed and so on.#apr.330.10
e,We can only guess that there was peanut dust on the floor.#apr.330.11
u,all allergic passengers should have or carry and be able to carry on board--epinephrine .#apr.330.12
u,Planes should also have them on flight due to reactions where 1. someone doesn't have theirs 2. first time reaction in someone who didn't know they were allergic.#apr.330.13
u,An EpiPen is not enough however.#apr.330.14
n,Allergic reactions can and may come back#apr.330.15
u,and patients usually need to be watched in a hospital for 4-6 hours following a reaction.#apr.330.16
n,Some may need IV treatment or other medications.#apr.330.17
u,In my opinion, all obvious peanut containing foods should be restricted--peanuts, peanut butter, peanut cookies, etc.#apr.330.18
u,The other products are not necessarily a concern from a dust standpoint but from a contact standpoint.#apr.330.19
n,Some individuals are allergic by touching a surface with peanut protein and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.#apr.330.20
u,Most kids do this and even adults rub their eyes.#apr.330.21
n,Peanut oil is "usually" so highly processed that no peanut protein remains--#apr.330.22
u,so that might not be an issue.#apr.330.23
n,Obviously there are always exceptions to the rule.#apr.330.24
u,Items labeled "may contain peanuts" or "processed in a facility w or  peanuts" would more than likely be too difficult to ban.#apr.330.25
u,I think the biggest issues are 1. peanut protein in dust from opening bags of peanuts.#apr.330.26
u,Solution-no bagged peanuts on flight.#apr.330.27
u,Examples are trays, floors, arm rests windows, etc.#apr.330.28
u,Solutions-a.Thorough cleanings between flights of ALL surfaces, b. banning all peanut containing products, c. adding a peanut buffer zone--#apr.330.29
u,but it must be peanut safe or free 100% of the time or completely cleaned.#apr.330.30
u,Honestly--bottom line is going 100% peanut free or safe is the easiest and safest solution for all.#apr.330.31
n,There are a million other foods and snacks to eat.#apr.330.32
n,These allergies can be severe and life threatening.#apr.330.33
u,The only instance where I can personally see a potential actual "need" for peanut or peanut butter is in the rare case that it is a "medical need" for a passenger due to their diet or a disability.#apr.330.34
u,In that case--I think there should be accommodations put in place for those passengers.#apr.330.35
u,I'm completely aware of the strong feelings and opinions a "ban" brings forth.#apr.330.36
u,Having a child and having seen a child suffer a life threatening reaction is not something I wish on anyone.#apr.330.37
u,Experiencing that in mid air with no access to an ambulance, ER or Dr. is beyond words.#apr.330.38
u,While peanut allergies and reactions are not necessarily common--#apr.330.39
n,they are by all means not uncommon and certainly not rare.#apr.330.40
u,We live in a society#apr.330.41
u,and as a society we often have to make accommodations for each other.#apr.330.42
e,We always carry a doctors note with us stating that our son needs his EpiPen.#apr.331.0
e,We've never been asked for the note and our EpiPens have never been taken, mentioned, or checked.#apr.331.1
e,We fly out of Logan Boston and Manchester NH.#apr.331.2
e,We've never flown with EpiPens out of country.#apr.331.3
u,I don't consider the needle to be that large.#apr.331.4
u,I guess it depends upon your definition of large.#apr.331.5
u,It's certainly not long.#apr.331.6
u,Probably not#apr.331.7
u,but I guess anything is possible if the person knows how to use it in such a way.#apr.331.8
u,I can't even imagine what that would be.#apr.331.9
u,I do not think there should be a compensation cap.#apr.334.0
u,If a passenger is bumped from a flight and misses an important business meeting, high school graduation or wedding, there is no price that can compensate for that.#apr.334.1
u,Certainly not $1300.#apr.334.2
n,In addition, even if the entire flight fare is refunded , there are other costs that the bumped passenger could face such as non-refundable or prepaid hotel reservations or other travel and travel related expenses.#apr.334.3
u,If a passenger can prove that he or she has additional expense above and beyond what the airline offers and the government requires he or she should be awarded more compensation.#apr.334.4
u,As for zero-fare tickets, for the same reasons above, I do not think compensating them with just miles is adequate.#apr.334.5
u,I am happy to volunteer if there is some sort of compensation and I am not in a huge rush or too inconvenienced.#apr.334.6
u,I was especially happy to do so when a group of 50and school students needed to get onboard together to fly from London to Dallas but the airline messed up.#apr.334.7
u,Volunteer opportunities and compensation should be posted or announced when one checks in  and continue to be posted and announced for all to see or hear until the last minute and the airline has to bump involuntarily.#apr.334.8
u,Any and all fees potentially associated with a fare should be disclosed in full, in a clear and concise manner.#apr.339.0
u,This should include differentiating between which charges originate from an airline and which don't, and should also include a clear explanation of the differences between what rights you have at different fare levels.#apr.339.1
u,The astronomical airport taxes levied at some international destinations spring immediately to mind as one charge that is mandatory for all fares, fixed, and something that will not vary if a consumer goes to shop with another airline.#apr.339.2
u,As far as post-purchase price changes go, they should be considered fraudulent.#apr.339.3
u,It would be one thing if the airlines automatically refunded you money when they re-price a flight below the price you paid at time of purchase,#apr.339.4
u,because the potential for price changes would then at least go both ways.#apr.339.5
u,But since no airline, as far as I know, offers anything like a pre-order guarantee,#apr.339.6
u,the price paid at the time of purchase needs to be the last word in what the flight costs.#apr.339.7
u,Barring any on-site add-ons like the customer bringing a heavy bag, or deciding to purchase an alcoholic beverage.#apr.339.8
u,No, no, no, no, no to a less-than-complete ban.#apr.341.0
u,If it's not an outright ban, the airlines, hotels, and tour operators will quickly concoct schemes to give themselves the right to do whatever they want to their prices after the fact.#apr.341.1
u,I feel for people with severe peanut allergies ;#apr.342.0
u,it must be terrible trying to avoid such a prevalent product.#apr.342.1
u,I don't see how creating a peanut-free "buffer zone" around pre-registered allergic flyers is going to be genuinely effective in planes due to the recirculating air, and seems likely to cause conflict between airline employees and the non-allergic passengers being affected.#apr.342.2
u,An outright ban of peanut-containing products on board airplanes, whether they're provided by the airline or brought on board by passengers, might be in order.#apr.342.3
u,That would likely also have to be coupled with a ban on the sale of peanut-containing products in airports.#apr.342.4
n,If we're addressing hazards to the health of passengers from products that the affected passengers themselves aren't even consuming, peanut allergies are not the only allergy or immune system problem that affects the flying public on a daily basis.#apr.342.5
u,Those types of rules seem like the logical follow-up to rules surrounding peanut allergies.#apr.342.6
u,I am a little skeptical that DOT has the power to implement this peanut ban.#apr.352.0
n,I would think that since Congress took away funding the last time that DOT tried to get rid of peanuts and DOT implicitly agreed to not take away peanuts, that DOT could not implement a peanut ban without Congress' express authorization.#apr.352.1
u,At the very least, I think the DOT needs much more legally based response to this question then is currently included in the notice of proposed rulemaking.#apr.352.2
u,It would seem to me that DOT is playing a little fast and loose with the idea that just because Congress hasnt put the ban in place again, it must not want the ban.#apr.352.3
u,It would seem to me that Congress would not have any reason to cut off funding over peanuts, if DOT hasnt tried this stunt since 1999.#apr.352.4
u,Also, the notice talks about Congress requiring a peer reviewed study about the effects of peanuts on planes.#apr.352.5
u,If so, why is it not included in the notice.#apr.352.6
u,I am not saying that the peanut ban is bad,#apr.352.7
n,but there are rules#apr.352.8
n,and it doesnt appear that DOT is playing by them.#apr.352.9
u,That's ridiculous.#apr.356.0
u,I agree that there needs to be some compensation for those who use miles.#apr.356.1
u,Also, airlines' refusal to put people on other airlines' flights has long annoyed me.#apr.356.2
u,I feel all airlines should be required to include one free checked bag up to 50 pounds per person per ticket.#apr.357.0
u,Anyone traveling by air is usually going somewhere where they need to bring luggage.#apr.357.1
u,Airplanes, in general, are not "commuter" vehicles to go get a coffee or go to work for the day.#apr.357.2
u,Most people are going somewhere at least overnight and obviously can not bring their car with them on the plane!#apr.357.3
u,Also, I feel the more luggage "carried on" increases the security risk.#apr.357.4
u,The fees for checked bags encourage people to carry more on which increases the risk of something "harmful" slipping onto the plane.#apr.357.5
u,One free checked bag of 50 pounds or less is not unreasonable.#apr.357.6
u,There should be no discrimination in how a passenger is bumped or compensated just because they may have paid less for a ticket or used frequent flyer miles.#apr.361.0
n,Airline tickets are not lottery tickets.#apr.361.1
u,One does not purchase a ticket hoping to reach a certain destination.#apr.361.2
u,Same as if one pays $4 for a cup of coffee or $1, the cup is supposed to have coffee in it.#apr.361.3
u,The price does not dictate that "maybe" you will get the product or service.#apr.361.4
n,Also, the airline decides what prices or miles are used to purchase a promise to get you from point A to point B.#apr.361.5
u,If they can not afford to give  a ticket for that price, they should not sell it.#apr.361.6
u,When you reserve a ticket, the assumption is that you will be taken from point A to point B by the times given by the airline.#apr.361.7
u,A passenger does not purchase a ticket just to see if maybe they can get somewhere because they have nothing better to do.#apr.361.8
u,If compensation is not high enough, the airlines will not have an incentive to schedule properly.#apr.361.9
u,It is not fair to allow airlines to discriminate against lower fared passengers or "free" passengers#apr.361.10
n,since it is the airline, not the passenger or government, who gave that passenger a seat.#apr.361.11
n,Otherwise, airlines can advertise low fares or con you into using them to build up your "miles" and then always bump you for someone who paid more.#apr.361.12
u,In away,it is the same as being able to increase your ticket price anytime after purchase.#apr.361.13
n,When you are bumped, there are a lot of hidden extra costs .#apr.361.14
u,It irks me that airlines seem to be treating passengers more and more as if they have nothing better to do but wait around in airports and not get to where the airline promised to bring them.#apr.361.15
n,Again, the airline sets the agreed price or miles for a seat, no one else.#apr.361.16
u,The incentives to the airline should be to get all confirmed passengers  to the destination promised.#apr.361.17
u,As I read through all the comments opposed to the peanut ban, I am amazed as to why some people feel it's more important to fight for the right to consume the snack of their choice, over the chance to help protect the life of another human being.#apr.366.0
n,It is a fact that peanuts DO KILL people.#apr.366.1
n,Yes, it is a small percentage of the current population -#apr.366.2
n,And keep in mind, peanut allergies have doubled over the last five years.#apr.366.3
u,So perhaps it will not be such a small percentage soon.#apr.366.4
u,I think it is a sad statement on our society that this even is a debatable issue.#apr.366.5
u,I would support a complete ban of peanuts and peanut products on aircraft carriers, as they are a confined, temporary space with no access to emergency medical assistance.#apr.366.6
u,Airplanes are different than airports, restaurants, taxis and other places that people have mentioned where a ban would not be necessary.#apr.366.7
u,In the future, I would also support a ban of ANY SUBSTANCE proven to cause death ...#apr.366.8
n,peanuts are not the only food.#apr.366.9
n,Tree nuts and shellfish can be just as deadly.#apr.366.10
u,And if it was proven that perfume, body odor or bad breath  was shown to cause death, then yes, those should be banned as well.#apr.366.11
n,It will not kill anyone to NOT EAT peanuts during the course of one flight.#apr.366.12
n,I WILL KILL someone with food allergies if they accidentally do.#apr.366.13
e,On a very recent trip for a 3-week stay the outbound trip was marred by the airline losing the bag for nearly three days.#apr.370.0
e,It was delivered to where I was staying 70 miles from the airport.#apr.370.1
e,The bag was damaged beyond repair#apr.370.2
e,the pull out handle was broken off -#apr.370.3
e,airline says it isn't covered.#apr.370.4
e,I had no vehicle to take the bag to their claim office - a 140 mile round trip in the state with the most expensive gasoline.#apr.370.5
e,I made a specific request that at a minimum my bag fee be refunded#apr.370.6
e,since I had to do without my belongings for almost three days.#apr.370.7
e,They flatly refused.#apr.370.8
u,I support a rule which would force a refund of any bag fee in the case of damage or delay.#apr.370.9
e,On a shorter trip I had only a carry-on which heeds the airline size limits.#apr.370.10
e,However, I was seated near the front and apparently people seated in the rear left their bags near the front.#apr.370.11
e,There were no forward spaces remaining when my group boarded.#apr.370.12
u,I don't know what might be the solution to that.#apr.370.13
u,As the mother of a severe peanut allergic child who has had an episode on an airplane that required epinephrine I would like to stress how important it is to remove all peanuts and peanut products from the plane.#apr.375.0
n,Even traces of peanut butter left on the tray table can pose a threat to someone with a severe peanut allergy.#apr.375.1
u,It is also important for crew to alert passengers through a public announcement and ask them not to eat peanuts that they have brought on board.#apr.375.2
n,This is becoming more common as airlines cut down on food service.#apr.375.3
u,America airlines are the worst in assisting passengers with peanut allergies.#apr.375.4
u,Airlines need to do what most schools today do:#apr.375.5
u,ban all peanut products#apr.375.6
u,and ban people from bringing peanuts and peanut products onto the plane.#apr.375.7
u,Flying is not a choice,#apr.375.8
u,it is often a necessity.#apr.375.9
u,It is hard to believe that this issue is even up for debate.#apr.375.10
u,If you take your daughter on a flight knowing that they serve peanuts, and knowing that her reactions are so severe, then you have created the problem, and that emergency landing should come out of your pocketbook.#apr.378.0
u,Consider that before you infringe upon the rights of hundreds of others to cater to your needs.#apr.378.1
u,Carry an epi pen or use alternate transportation rather than expecting the world to bow to your needs.#apr.378.2
u,It's simply not realistic.#apr.378.3
u,How about people with gluten allergies...#apr.379.0
u,we better ban pretzels too...#apr.379.1
u,This isn't a DOT issue,#apr.379.2
u,it's not a disability issue like a person that needs a ramp for a wheelchair,#apr.379.3
u,it's a common sense issue that requires the person with the disability to prepare for the isolated emergency by taking proper steps like an epi pen, or an allergy tablet, the same as they would anywhere else, rather than expecting a controlling governmental agency to impose more bans that in effect infringe upon the rights of far more people...#apr.379.4
u,things have gotten far out of control.#apr.379.5
n,I know two people exactly like this that have been able to work the system well enough to get such placards when they don't deserve or require them,#apr.379.6
u,they're in fact lazy.#apr.379.7
u,At some point, this nonsense has to stop.#apr.379.8
u,I've long believed that airlines purposely don't announce delays because of the consequences of doing so.#apr.383.0
n,If a flight is delayed due to weather the airline has no obligation to provide any remedy to the affected passengers.#apr.383.1
n,Whereas a delay due to a mechanical problem may require compensation or accommodation be made.#apr.383.2
u,I support an outright ban.#apr.391.0
u,First, simply as a peanut allergy sufferer, a key travel worry of mine would be allayed.#apr.391.1
u,Second, either the creation of a buffer-zone or removal of peanuts base on a passenger's request is impractical.#apr.391.2
u,Finding appropriate seat arrangements for everyone is completely impractical and time-consuming, delaying take-off.#apr.391.3
u,It also distracts flight attendants from completing their job.#apr.391.4
u,Second, among all of the other things a passenger needs to be keep in mind when traveling, notifying the airline of a peanut allergy should not be one of them.#apr.391.5
u,One possible solution is to have a little box checked off when booking a ticket to indicate a peanut allergy.#apr.391.6
u,But given the myriad of ways in which tickets are booked and purchased today, this is unlikely to be completely successful.#apr.391.7
u,The most practical solution is to just ban them on flights.#apr.391.8
u,The decision is not based on the risk to allergy and non-allergy passengers, but the costs of different solutions.#apr.391.9
u,It seems that so many people on this forum want perfect, cushy, super-convenient, AND inexpensive airline travel.#apr.393.0
u,Unfortunately, that is IMPOSSIBLE.#apr.393.1
u,Since airlines have to be competitive AND make a profit for their investors, things will NOT be perfect.#apr.393.2
n,Also, since people are human,#apr.393.3
u,there will be errors made by airline personnel.#apr.393.4
u,Some of these comments just sound like people want to do what they want  but yet get 100% of their fare refunded regardless if the airline is able to sell that seat or not.#apr.393.5
u,In other words, it sounds like "to hell with the airlines".#apr.393.6
u,Remember, the more regulations government puts on companies, the more prices go up.#apr.393.7
u,the DOT is just recognizing a product that is being provided by companies that pose a serious threat to a fairly large number of people.#apr.401.0
n,Most other products aboard flights are considered non-allergenic or do not have particulates that become airborne#apr.401.1
n,which is the case with the bagged peanuts.#apr.401.2
u,Also, finding another mode of transportation is not an option for me as I might be the Captain on your flight one day.#apr.401.3
u,I would think that suggestion is not realistic.#apr.401.4
u,I understand that for those who do not have that or an allergy it might seem "overblown"#apr.401.5
u,but I can assure you that overall, it is not.#apr.401.6
u,It is simply a desire to eliminate a #1 food allergy product that can become airborne in a small, pressurized aluminum  tube.#apr.401.7
n,Yes, perfumes and many other products are allergens, most would be classified as irritants and are not life threatening.#apr.402.0
n,Peanuts are in a unique class of allergen that is quite widespread among the general population that has airborne particulate and that can be life threatening.#apr.402.1
u,This is about documents risk mitigation for a voluntary product provided by a company.#apr.402.2
u,You articulated that very, very well.#apr.403.0
u,Welcome to my world as a severe peanut allergy sufferer and airline Captain.#apr.403.1
e,I have been dealing with this for over 22 years!#apr.403.2
u,I am yearning for the day  that I do not have to tell, an incredulous, flight attendant that I need a peanut free zone if I have to travel in the cabin!#apr.403.3
n,The problem has increased over the years with the advent of more efficient turbofan engines.#apr.404.0
n,It was found that excessive bleed air extraction from the engines  consumes more fuel than recirculating the air.#apr.404.1
n,Unlike the "coal burners" of the past, modern jets recirculate much more of the air.#apr.404.2
n,Yes, they go through filters#apr.404.3
u,but it is quite noticeable when those filters need to be changed, airflow decreases dramatically.#apr.404.4
n,With airlines scrambling to make money, non safety related items take a back seat and those expensive filters, I believe, are not changed as often.#apr.404.5
u,Also, your point about the number of people that died aboard a flight is only part of the question.#apr.404.6
u,Airport Crash Fire and Rescue facilities would be a valuable asset for those statistics as they are the ones to meet a flight if a passenger was ill.#apr.404.7
n,Yes, most airlines pay flight crew members scheduled flight time or actual time away from the gate whichever is more.#apr.405.0
n,Eg. if a flight is scheduled for 2 hours "block to block"  but it takes 3 to fly it, the crew gets 3.#apr.405.1
n,If the flight leaves that gate and returns 2.5 hours later, most airlines only pay that crew either the 2.0 scheduled  or much less.#apr.405.2
u,For most crewmembers, the notion that 1 hour at the gate, 2.5 hours of sitting on that taxiway and only get paid for 2 is not very palatable.#apr.405.3
n,Whereas sitting for 2.5 hours then fly 2 totals 4.5.#apr.405.4
u,It is mostly the pay structure of pilots or flight attendants that poorly designed.#apr.405.5
u,Most people would balk at the notion of working 4.5 hours and getting paid for 2.#apr.405.6
u,I also agree with others who have suggested that if the airline changes your itinerary after you've paid, you should have the right to get a full refund on that trip.#apr.411.0
u,I think these are appropriate for both foreign and domestic flights, and should be part of the carriers contract of carriage.#apr.411.1
u,For those arguing that regulating the industry will raise prices, I'd suggest they look at the history of other regulated injuries.#apr.411.2
u,Often the changes industry have had to implement to comply with government regulations have led to them becoming more efficient organizations.#apr.411.3
n,And in these cases prices have gone down not up.#apr.411.4
n,Remember, the airlines are not just carrying cargo, they're transporting human beings.#apr.411.5
u,And it's important that there be enforceable standards for how these humans are to be treated when in the sky.#apr.411.6
u,I, for one, am happy to see the end of this "Wild West" of the American airline industry.#apr.411.7
u,You make an excellent point!#apr.412.0
u,I hope this is also considered by the DOT#apr.412.1
u,no one expects perfection.#apr.413.0
u,But the way slots are allotted at airports has created monopolies in many markets.#apr.413.1
u,So there is, in reality, no "competition" which would solve the problems consumers are having in the air.#apr.413.2
u,Its time for the government to step in and make sure that passengers are treated respectfully and that codes of conduct are standardized across the industry.#apr.413.3
n,If you look at the history of other industries you'll find that government regulations have not caused prices to rise.#apr.413.4
n,In fact, regulations have forced these industries to be more efficient and prices have actually dropped.#apr.413.5
u,So I think this argument is a spurious one.#apr.413.6
u,The DOT should require posting of occupancy based rates similarly to the posting of one way fares.#apr.414.0
u,The purchase price quoted should be the purchase price.#apr.414.1
u,The idea that a consumer could purchase a product and weeks or months later after vacation time has been booked at work and other plans made, the price could be increased is absolutely wrong.#apr.414.2
u,The only additions to an airfare should be government mandated taxes and fees.#apr.415.0
u,Surcharges should not be allowed in any case.#apr.415.1
n,Fuel, for example, is part of the airline's basic cost.#apr.415.2
u,It should not be an add on to a fare, but part of it.#apr.415.3
u,If an airline wants to charge more on a certain day, the base fare should include that charge.#apr.415.4
u,It should never be added on.#apr.415.5
u,And the proposed rule that the total fare be shown is the only appropriate way to avoid deceptive practices.#apr.415.6
u,If an airline wishes to inform a customer about the cost of taxes, is should be allowed to list the base fare before taxes in no greater than 1 or 2 the typeface of the total fare along with the total fare.#apr.415.7
e,I have been allergic to peanuts for nearly 40-years!#apr.419.0
e,I typically fly Southwest Airlines - a leading airline in distributing peanuts to passengers as THE ONLY SNACK on many of their flights.#apr.419.1
e,After a typical flight, I will have itchy, watery eyes sometimes to the point where I can barely keep my eyes open.#apr.419.2
u,Luckily my allergy is not AS BAD as many -#apr.419.3
u,but I can empathize with those with worse conditions.#apr.419.4
e,In Southwest's defense, if I would call ahead of time and inform them I was allergic to peanuts they would gladly air out the aircraft and refrain from serving peanuts on my flight.#apr.419.5
u,Although I am not against the idea of peanuts being restricted from all flights,#apr.419.6
u,I do appreciate people's comments regarding the absurdity of such an all-encompassing rule.#apr.419.7
u,I think an effective and simple solution might be to ask passengers either verbally when tickets are purchased person-to-person, or via a question prior to an e-ticket purchase that asks the traveler if they are allergic to peanuts.#apr.419.8
n,If yes - then that particular flight can be aired out of prior peanuts and peanuts not served on that flight.#apr.419.9
u,I look forward to seeing the outcome to this issue.#apr.419.10
u,The notification isn't so much a problem at most airports.#apr.421.0
n,The electronic boards are usually updated minute by minute.#apr.421.1
u,The problem is that the airlines will say "Flight 100, delayed till 7:00pm." then "Flight 100, delayed till 7:05pm".#apr.421.2
n,And so on and so forth.#apr.421.3
u,They're notifying everyone...with completely useless information.#apr.421.4
u,Forcing them to do so more frequently isn't going to fix a thing.#apr.421.5
u,Forcing them to come up with an accurate estimate is what is needed.#apr.421.6
u,If you charge for a service , and do not provide that service... then a refund is in order.#apr.422.0
n,Package services refund based on service actually rendered,#apr.422.1
u,Two hours is reasonable in most cases.#apr.422.2
u,It depends on the passenger, and may require more complex itenerary tracking.#apr.422.3
e,On a flight to Hawaii, my bag was delayed about 4 hours, and delivered to my hotel.#apr.422.4
u,No big deal.#apr.422.5
u,If I had been flying somewhere to take a cruise, that could have been a very big deal.#apr.422.6
n,Some carriers already do this, in certain circumstances.#apr.422.7
e,I have been able to get refunds from regional carriers for taking a bus.#apr.422.8
e,It is, however, impossible to get this information from the central reservations number ,#apr.422.9
u,and the lines at the airport are usually so long that it's almost impossible to talk with anyone FROM the regional carrier to find out if the refund applies.#apr.422.10
u,Mandating it would simply enforce an already unwritten policy, and provide guidance to the central reservations people about what compensation is due.#apr.422.11
u,I think it needs to be spelled out.#apr.422.12
u,Particularly to include refunding frequent-flyer miles.#apr.422.13
u,At 2 cents a mile, you think they'd be more willing to give those back.#apr.422.14
n,Some travel sites already have on-time estimates.#apr.422.15
u,I think all carriers should provide that.#apr.422.16
u,Maybe a flight is cheap, but never actually takes off.#apr.422.17
u,What is so special about an international airline.#apr.422.18
u,Planes are planes, customers are customers.#apr.422.19
u,Just because you fly between countries doesn't mean that service is more difficult.#apr.422.20
u,The airline should, of course, only be responsible for the delivery of passenger and bags TO Immigration or Customs.#apr.422.21
n,If there is a hold in Immigration or Customs, that's a different government department to deal with.#apr.422.22
u,If the airlines decide to reduce benefits in the contract of carriage, that might actually be a good thing.#apr.422.23
u,Right now, it's a roll of the dice.#apr.422.24
n,You HAVE to stand in the 1 hour long service line#apr.422.25
n,because you MIGHT get a refund, or a few bucks...#apr.422.26
u,I'd rather know that it wasn't coming, and to give up and get a hotel, than to stand in the line and beg like a puppy for a treat.#apr.422.27
u,Customers should be able to sue the airline in any appropriate jurisdiction.#apr.422.28
u,If the airline doesn't have a lawyer in said jurisdiction, I'd hope they can FLY ONE THERE!#apr.422.29
u,I think all services should be listed.#apr.423.0
u,Including the real perks like $90 upgrade to first-class domestic.#apr.423.1
u,For a 'full fare' price, go back to what airlines provided during regulation days, and figure out what ammenities have been removed.#apr.423.2
u,Then list those.#apr.423.3
u,All airlines need to comply.#apr.423.4
n,Restaurants don't go out of business just because they list their prices on the menu.#apr.423.5
u,I don't think airlines will either.#apr.423.6
u,There's no truth to what you say about recycled air on planes.#apr.427.0
n,Contrary to your belief, fresh air is circulated in the cabin from the engine compressors, air conditioned , circulated through louvers, vents and those eyeball graspers above your seat.#apr.427.1
n,After that, about half is sucked out through the bottom of the fuselage;#apr.427.2
n,the remainder is run through filters to remove pollutants and particulants and mixed with fresh air again.#apr.427.3
n,The result is that the air in the cabin is cleaner than most public buildings,#apr.427.4
n,and it is completely exchanged every 2-3 minutes.#apr.427.5
u,There's no reason to restrict peanuts on any flight.#apr.429.0
n,The number of deaths per year due to anaphylaxis  is much, much smaller than other causes of death .#apr.429.1
u,People who actually suffer from a severe allergic reaction to peanuts know what precautions to take,#apr.429.2
u,and their condition should never infringe on the rights of others.#apr.429.3
u,If they can't deal with the risk they take every day, no matter where they are, then they should be living in a bubble.#apr.429.4
u,Instead of blaming others for their real or perceived allergy, they should take steps to desenstize themselves to peanuts,#apr.429.5
n,which can be done,#apr.429.6
n,as studies have shown.#apr.429.7
n,Even better, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University developed a way to remove the allergens from peanuts in 2007,#apr.429.8
u,so if the various food companies that process and market peanuts take an interest in licensing this technology, people can avoid any fear of allergic reactions from peanuts.#apr.429.9
n,You can read the press release here:#apr.429.10
u,You simply have no idea what you're talking about.#apr.430.0
n,There is no "diagnosis rate" of peanut allergies;#apr.430.1
u,there is a common, misguided belief that peanut allergies are rising and that any reaction to any food is an allergy.#apr.430.2
n,Unfortunately for you, you actually need to be observed and tested by a licensed, certified doctor for the presence of IgE antibodies to determine if you really have an allergy.#apr.430.3
u,Furthermore, if you really think that 1 in 100 having a true allergy to peanuts is huge, you're daft.#apr.430.4
u,That would be 1%, which is 3.3 million people in the U.S.-not a huge number at all.#apr.430.5
u,Far more people  are allergic to one or more types of dust,#apr.430.6
u,but you aren't proposing that the FAA should ban dust,#apr.430.7
n,since that's not possible without shutting down air travel altogether.#apr.430.8
u,Maybe we should just ban people with peanut allergies from flying;#apr.430.9
n,that would certainly solve your problem.#apr.430.10
n,With nearly 2 million peanut allergic people out there#apr.446.0
n,and the severely allergic classed under ADA protection,#apr.446.1
u,the airlines should not serve peanuts in any form on any flight.#apr.446.2
u,I am severely allergic as are my twin sons#apr.446.3
u,and we cannot fly without specific guarantees from the airline for our safety.#apr.446.4
n,Sorry, most "studies" don't draw any distinction between reported allergies and actual, clinically diagnosed allergies, with the possible exception of the language they use.#apr.449.0
u,Every one that I've read glosses over such distinctions,#apr.449.1
u,so you have to read them carefully to see how the "study" data was obtained.#apr.449.2
n,If not, then there's no way to confirm you have an allergy to them.#apr.450.0
n,You can be intolerant of peanuts,#apr.450.1
n,but that's not the same thing as an allergy,#apr.450.2
n,and allergies are not inherited.#apr.450.3
u,If you're looking for guarantees for safety from an airline or anything else, you're not going to get that, ever.#apr.450.4
u,You take risks like everyone else no matter what you do.#apr.450.5
n,And the ADA does not extend any protection to you,#apr.450.6
n,since allergies are not a disability.#apr.450.7
n,The courts have consistently ruled against this.#apr.450.8
n,No, there is no ADA protection for allergy sufferers, nor has there ever been.#apr.451.0
n,You already tried this argument in the previous comment section.#apr.451.1
u,If not, then you don't know he has an allergy;#apr.454.0
n,you have only anecdotal evidence,#apr.454.1
n,which is often mistaken for true allergies.#apr.454.2
u,You can fly with your son, you simply choose not to because of your unfounded fear that something will happen;#apr.454.3
u,that's a choice you made#apr.454.4
u,and it can't be blamed on the airlines or anyone else.#apr.454.5
u,You take far greater risks with yourself and your son every day,#apr.454.6
e,yet somehow you've managed to live this long.#apr.454.7
u,You're not able to objectively evaluate your risk,#apr.454.8
u,which is why you fall into the trap of being afraid of things that are very unlikely to happen.#apr.454.9
n,Far more people die every year from drowning,#apr.454.10
n,but I don't think that's ever stopped you from going to a pool,#apr.454.11
u,or that it would stop you from letting your son go swimming in a pool.#apr.454.12
u,Instead of conflating the remotely possible and the inevitable. step back and look at things objectively;#apr.454.13
u,when you do, you'll see there are many things that are far more likely to happen than having a severe allergic reaction on a plane.#apr.454.14
n,Even so, you can desensitize your son#apr.454.15
u,so that if he has a true peanut allergy now, he won't in the future.#apr.454.16
n,If not, then you don't know if they have an allergy, or even to what severity.#apr.455.0
n,As for your claim that she could die if peanuts are ingested in her vicinity, that is utterly false.#apr.455.1
n,The only way to have any reaction  is to have contact with the offending allergen.#apr.455.2
u,So anyone else can eat all they like in her vicinity;#apr.455.3
n,she just has to not come in contact with it.#apr.455.4
n,Some people die from a severe reaction to peanuts, but not many,#apr.455.5
n,and I've yet to find a single instance of an airline passenger dying due to anaphylactic shock caused by peanuts.#apr.455.6
u,You have a responsibility to keep your child safe.#apr.463.0
n,You don't let them play in traffic#apr.463.1
n,but we don't ban cars.#apr.463.2
u,This is no different.#apr.463.3
u,It is YOUR responsibility, it is not the airline's or the government's job to keep everything away from people that can hurt them#apr.463.4
u,Whatever you pick, someone out there has a SEVERE allergy to it that can kill them.#apr.463.5
n,The shampoo ban is supposed to be to prevent liquid explosives from being brought onboard, not to prevent exposure to some allergic to it.#apr.464.0
n,Sure I can "survive" without eating peanuts,#apr.464.1
n,but you know what, you can also survive without flying wherever it is you are going,#apr.464.2
n,I think most tarmac delays are either weather related or traffic related.#apr.474.0
n,At some airports, there are simply so many flights in an out that they can never keep up.#apr.474.1
u,Or, when the weather is bad, taking off simply isn't viable so flights back up.#apr.474.2
u,I think the suggestion of having the airlines and airports create "holding" areas for delays is very interesting.#apr.474.3
u,It would be like a remote terminal for planes that had already boarded and left the official gate areas.#apr.474.4
u,These remote terminals would allow deplaning and have restrooms, emergency and other important facilities.#apr.474.5
n,Obviously, there are logistics issues involved,#apr.474.6
u,but some serious thought about this might pay off.#apr.474.7
u,There would of course be costs involved,#apr.474.8
u,but if they're spread across the industry, I can't imagine that the ultimate cost to the consumer would be very much,#apr.474.9
u,and the availability of such facilities would be a great benefit.#apr.474.10
u,Such a plan would probably only work at large airports that experience frequent delays,#apr.474.11
u,so there would need to be a separate set of rules for the smaller airports,#apr.474.12
u,which couldn't really be expected to build remote terminal facilities.#apr.474.13
e,I'm a physician, epidemiologist, and mother to a four year old boy with allergies to milk, peanuts and egg.#apr.482.0
e,My son's dairy allergy is severe,#apr.482.1
e,and he has had numerous life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to trace amounts of milk,#apr.482.2
n,which required multiple doses of epinephrine and trips to the Emergency Department.#apr.482.3
e,Tests indicate that his peanut allergy is worse,#apr.482.4
e,but fortunately he has only been exposed once to a peanut;#apr.482.5
e,he put one in his mouth and had a relatively mild  reaction.#apr.482.6
e,I've traveled with my children#apr.482.7
e,and despite calling ahead, making requests, and reminding employees at the door, I've rarely had respect, let alone consistency, in any kind of peanut-free buffer zone or flight.#apr.482.8
e,Several years ago Continental Airlines customer service headquarters informed me that they would serve peanuts on all flights#apr.482.9
e,as they were unable to guarantee a peanut free flight.#apr.482.10
u,So why not hand out weapons#apr.482.11
e,I've sat with my epi pen in hand on a filthy flight with visible peanut crumbs on the floor while a flight attendant insisted on offering peanuts to the passengers around me because "it was their right."#apr.482.12
e,Fortunately for me, my son's peanut allergy is not severe enough that it prohibits us from air travel.#apr.482.13
e,Now that he is old enough to not put things in his mouth, and to protect himself,#apr.482.14
u,we are safer.#apr.482.15
e,However, I know of many, many others in the allergy community, children and adults who simply can NOT fly.#apr.482.16
e,My son's dairy allergy is quite severe.#apr.482.17
e,The world would be a much safer place for us if no one consumed milk near him.#apr.482.18
e,If his skin touches anything that once touched milk, even if it was partially cleaned, he will get severe hives.#apr.482.19
e,If he consumes even less than a drop, within seconds his lips, eyes and face will swell, he will be covered in hives, vomit, and be gasping for breath.#apr.482.20
n,Without epinephrine he would probably die within minutes.#apr.482.21
n,But milk is ubiquitous,#apr.482.22
n,and milk allergy relatively uncommon,#apr.482.23
u,so we must protect ourselves.#apr.482.24
n,Peanut allergy is common,#apr.482.25
u,and it is a simple step to serve an alternative peanut based snacks for a short period of time.#apr.482.26
u,The vast majority of potential reactions would be eliminated by simply avoiding snacks that have peanuts or peanut butter as an ingredient.#apr.482.27
n,Peanut oil is known to contain very little of the actual peanut protein, and would be of little risk in an airborne environment.#apr.482.28
e,As a physician, I have responded to the call from airline staff asking for emergency medical assistance.#apr.482.29
e,I am well aware of how expensive and inconvenient it is to ground a plane.#apr.482.30
n,In addition, most epi-pens come in two pack doses, each of which are good for maybe 10 to 15 minutes.#apr.482.31
n,Which in a severe anaphylactic reaction is simply not enough time between the beginning of a reaction and the patient reaching EMS.#apr.482.32
u,I've found that other passengers, as a rule, are extremely supportive, and are more than happy to help with a fellow passengers safety.#apr.482.33
u,I think the people commenting on this site would react entirely differently were they seated next to an allergic child on a plane.#apr.482.34
u,Of course they would refrain from eating peanuts for a few hours if they knew it would hurt someone they were looking in the face.#apr.482.35
u,But I am sympathetic to individuals who are unhappy with yet another discomfort inflicted on air travelers.#apr.482.36
u,This restriction is designed to protect people with allergies from the airlines callous disregard for cleanliness and for our safety, not from our fellow passengers.#apr.482.37
e,I am 4 years old.#apr.482.38
e,I am allergic to peanuts, eggs and cow milk.#apr.482.39
e,If I eat a peanut I'll get sick.#apr.482.40
e,I ate a nut one time and got a big bump on my lip#apr.482.41
e,and it swelled up#apr.482.42
e,and it was hard to breathe.#apr.482.43
u,It was scary#apr.482.44
e,and my dad gave me some medicine that made it better.#apr.482.45
u,I would like for them to not give out peanuts#apr.482.46
n,so I won't get sick#apr.482.47
n,because I'm allergic.#apr.482.48
u,Everybody should drink Sprite and eat Pringles and Pretzels.#apr.482.49
u,Frankly, I am horrified at the negative attitudes and comments from people who feel their rights are being taken away should peanuts  be banned from flights.#apr.497.0
u,Perhaps they should be made to watch a person in a true anaphylactic situation.#apr.497.1
e,I have a granddaughter who has multiple food allergies including peanuts and tree nuts.#apr.497.2
e,Her parents do a wonderful job of making sure that her surroundings are as safe as possible, providing appropriate food, and carrying all of the medications my granddaughter might need.#apr.497.3
e,The whole family absolutely accepts that these precautions are our responsibility.#apr.497.4
u,However, when one is on an aircraft one does not have the option of pulling the emergency cord to stop the flight so that one can get to a hospital.#apr.497.5
u,This is the reason why a total ban on peanut products needs to be made.#apr.497.6
u,We have all been on flights where it is obvious that the cleaning crew did not have time to do a thorough job on the areas that can be seen.#apr.497.7
u,Probably not often enough to remove airborn allergens.#apr.497.8
e,Our home airport is a Delta hub.#apr.497.9
u,Delta does not believe in peanut free flights.#apr.497.10
n,Jet Blue does not fly here.#apr.497.11
n,Flying other companies means making at least one, and frequently two, changes of plane#apr.497.12
u,thus making the travel time unduly long and stressful.#apr.497.13
u,Whoever is sitting next to my granddaughter cannot risk falling asleep in case she should have a reaction and not be able to self-inject -#apr.497.14
e,she is eight years old.#apr.497.15
n,The Food Allergy Initiative states: "The prevalence of peanut and tree nut allergies tripled in children in the United States between 1997 and 2008, according to an FAI-sponsored study conducted by Scott Sicherer, MD, and colleagues at Mount Sinai School of Medicine . The study was published in the June 2010 issue of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, the official journal of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. "#apr.497.16
n,Our research shows that more than 3 million Americans report peanut or tree nut allergies, representing a significant health burden, said Dr. Sicherer.#apr.497.17
u,The data also emphasize the importance of developing better prevention and treatment strategies.#apr.497.18
n,When trying to explain the reason for this increase the FAI suggests#apr.497.19
u,Another explanation could be the popularity of roasted peanuts in the U.S.#apr.497.20
u,Maybe the peanut supporters should put their efforts into making the move towards the healthier snack of raw peanuts  and see if this will help protect the future youth of America.#apr.497.21
n,The roasting process appears to alter the peanut protein, making it more likely to trigger an allergy.#apr.502.0
n,Nobody has studied this subject,#apr.502.1
n,so there's no hard data.#apr.502.2
u,But we do know that the air onboard an airliner is much cleaner than people think.#apr.502.3
n,Only one confirmed death onboard an airliner has been reported,#apr.502.4
n,but it may have been as far back as 1998,#apr.502.5
e,No, I'm just an allergy sufferer  like most of the population.#apr.503.0
e,The difference is that I actually know a good number of people in the airline industry as well as reading lots of research papers on the subject of peanut allergies.#apr.503.1
u,I tire of the constant harping that peanut allergies are on the rise,#apr.503.2
n,when there is no scientific data to back it up.#apr.503.3
u,I do believe that people need to educate themselves as to what is a real allergy, rather than simply an adverse reaction to a particular food.#apr.503.4
u,Far too often, people  quickly label an adverse reaction as an allergy, without testing them to be certain.#apr.503.5
u,Then they hammer away at the child that they can't have certain foods or have to be REALLY CAREFUL or they'll die.#apr.503.6
u,That creates needless anxiety for the child and causes a great deal of psychological damage to them.#apr.503.7
n,and it was an Eastern European airline.#apr.505.0
n,In the late 1990's  the U.S. Department of Transportation proposed that airlines provide peanut-allergic passengers with 'peanut free' seating areas.#apr.505.1
n,The proposal was denied by congress due to the lack of evidence demonstrating that peanut dust inhalation causes anaphylaxis.#apr.505.2
n,Studies have shown that inhalation of peanut dust can cause a reaction for those allergic to peanut,#apr.505.3
n,but the reaction is typically restricted to skin and upper-respiratory symptoms and does not usually result in anaphylaxis.#apr.505.4
n,That being said, it has been shown that when multiple people are eating peanuts together on an airplane the reaction can be sufficiently serious to require epinephrine.#apr.505.5
n,In addition, the dust and residue left from peanuts or peanut products can cause anaphylaxis when transferred to the mouth, nose, or eyes.#apr.505.6
n,Since that proposal, according to the Food Allergy Initiative the latest data suggests that food allergies have actually TRIPLED between 1997 and 2008.#apr.505.7
n,That number is continuing to grow and affect families on a daily basis.#apr.505.8
e,My family is one of them,#apr.505.9
e,as we have been dealing with my son's food allergies for many years.#apr.505.10
e,My son has never been to a live sporting event.#apr.505.11
e,Going to the circus caused hives on his face#apr.505.12
e,so we left immediately.#apr.505.13
e,He's reacted when people around us are eating peanut butter cookies.#apr.505.14
u,Flying is extremely nerve wracking for our entire family#apr.505.15
u,and therefore we limit it as much as possible.#apr.505.16
n,DOT wants to know how likely it is for a person with peanut allergies to suffer a reaction on a flight.#apr.505.17
u,That question is very difficult to answer.#apr.505.18
n,According to a recent study by the University of Michigan Division of Allergies and Clinical Immunology, 1 in 3 people that are reacting to nuts or peanuts are suffering from anaphylaxis,#apr.505.19
n,so it is happening.#apr.505.20
u,If my child were to step on to an airplane  with no precautions taken I have no doubt he'd react.#apr.505.21
u,I can't say#apr.505.22
e,because we've never let his reactions progress#apr.505.23
u,nor would we ever take that chance.#apr.505.24
u,Anaphylaxis is a tricky thing#apr.505.25
u,because one never knows at what point a reaction will stop or get worse.#apr.505.26
e,We take a number of steps to prevent any reactions from occurring- not just when we fly, but every day of his life.#apr.505.27
n,While its highly unlikely to have a reaction from smelling something,#apr.505.28
u,the chances of having an airborne reaction from the dust of peanuts going into your airways is highly likely,#apr.505.29
u,as is the chance that the dust from peanuts or residue from a PB and J sandwich from the passenger before you getting onto an allergic person's seat and then onto that person's hands and then into their mouth, nose or eye is also likely.#apr.505.30
e,There are many plane trips we have not made#apr.505.31
u,because it is just too stressful to fly even when we do dose him with Benadryl, wipe down everything around us including the seat belt, cover the seat with a crib sheet, bring our own safe food, and an entire back pack filled with his epi pens , Benadryl, inhalers, steroid creams , and his prescription strength antihistamines.#apr.505.32
u,Being prepared has certainly lessened the chance that he'll have a reaction,#apr.505.33
u,but we have still had mystery hives while flying.#apr.505.34
e,My son has missed out on many plane trips to fly to his grandparent's house that he watches his sister take#apr.505.35
u,because it's just too dangerous for him.#apr.505.36
e,We've driven over 5000 miles in the last year alone just to see family- taking 2 days of driving instead of 2 hours of flying.#apr.505.37
u,As for having epinephrine onboard the plane, that is a great idea.#apr.505.38
u,I personally think everyone should carry epi pens#apr.505.39
n,because a person can become allergic at any point in their life to a myriad of foods, medicines, and animals.#apr.505.40
n,Epinephrine can be a lifesaver,#apr.505.41
n,but it isn't always.#apr.505.42
u,If not given before the blood pressure drops there is no way for it to move throughout the body and stop the reaction.#apr.505.43
n,There are also cases where the epi pens fail.#apr.505.44
n,Once given, the injection may only last 20 minutes before the reaction can start again, only worse.#apr.505.45
u,I would love for my son to be able to fly without a fear of going into anaphylaxis.#apr.505.46
u,I think that any steps that the DOT could take to lessen his reactions would be welcome.#apr.505.47
n,In the US, those who suffer from food allergies that can be life-threatening, including peanut allergy, may be covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act  as well as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  which does prohibit disability-based discrimination.#apr.505.48
e,We currently try to fly only United#apr.505.49
n,because they only serve nuts in first class,#apr.505.50
e,but in some cases have had to fly other airlines as well.#apr.505.51
n,I have found out that if you make too big of a deal with American Airlines they won't let you board the plane.#apr.505.52
u,I quickly downplayed my son's allergies and hoped for the best on that flight.#apr.505.53
u,A buffer zone won't do a bit of good#apr.505.54
u,because the peanut dust can easily travel all over the plane.#apr.505.55
u,A person could eat a bag of peanuts and then open the restroom door.#apr.505.56
u,My son could then also open the restroom door, rub his eye and have an anaphylactic reaction.#apr.505.57
u,I think a ban of all peanuts and nuts  would be the safest route for those with peanut allergies.#apr.505.58
u,If there are going to be set rules, the easiest thing to do is ban all peanuts and peanut products from being brought onto planes.#apr.505.59
u,While this will inconvenience many people I am sure,#apr.505.60
u,it should be worth it if it saves even one life.#apr.505.61
u,And to the poster above, yes, life threatening allergies ARE a disability.#apr.505.62
n,The definition of disability is: For purposes of nondiscrimination laws , a person with a disability is generally defined as someone who  has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more "major life activities,  has a record of such an impairment, or  is regarded as having such an impairment.#apr.505.63
u,Breathing is a major life activity.#apr.505.64
n,Except the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to public places and employers who receive federal funds.#apr.524.0
u,That means it doesn't apply to airline passengers.#apr.524.1
n,Peanut allergies are not a disability;#apr.524.2
u,if they were, then everyone who has any allergy would qualify for protection".#apr.524.3
u,You and everyone else who thinks we should ban peanuts and everything else you might have a problem with suffer from worst-case thinking:#apr.524.4
u,There's a certain blindness that comes from worst-case thinking.#apr.524.5
u,An extension of the precautionary principle, it involves imagining the worst possible outcome and then acting as if it were a certainty.#apr.524.6
u,It substitutes imagination for thinking, speculation for risk analysis, and fear for reason.#apr.524.7
n,Actually, Title III of the The Americans with Disabilities Act applies the same requirement as Title II does to certain private entities that own, lease, or operate places of public accommodation.#apr.526.0
u,That means that those with disabilities have equal access to public establishments.#apr.526.1
u,First, stop reading that propaganda magazine.#apr.566.0
u,Publications like that only serve to create fear in minds like yours.#apr.566.1
u,If under 5, relax the sensitivity will probably go away by the time he is 5.#apr.566.2
u,Third, go to a real doctor - not an allergist and see if there is really even a problem at all.#apr.566.3
u,This supposed plague of food allergies is the result of very clever advertising by this profession of pseudo-scientists.#apr.566.4
u,Allergists are not doctors.#apr.566.5
u,You seem to be the only voice of reason in this entire thread.#apr.568.0
n,Not only is there no supporting data for these claims, the claims are from 2006.#apr.574.0
u,It takes more than blind recitation of numbers to make a case.#apr.574.1
u,You're the one who seems to be partisan.#apr.575.0
u,Instead of thinking logically about it, you try to deflect blame for your misguided apprehension onto others by insinuating they have a compulsion.#apr.575.1
u,Serving and eating peanuts is not a public health menace,#apr.575.2
u,so you need to get over it.#apr.575.3
u,Instead of conflating the possible with the inevitable, you should focus on the reality,#apr.575.4
n,which is that the possibility is extremely small.#apr.575.5
u,You're more likely to die from getting hit by a car crossing the street,#apr.575.6
n,yet you're not advocating we ban driving.#apr.575.7
u,That's being a hypocrite.#apr.575.8
n,Between the U.S. and Canada, approximately 3.3 million people suffer from peanut and or or tree nut allergies,#apr.577.0
n,but a much smaller subset have potentially life-threatening reactions when exposed.#apr.577.1
u,If these alleged sufferers want to live their lives in fear, they are willfully giving up their right to travel by air or any other method,#apr.577.2
n,because the air they breathe anywhere could contain peanut dust, oil, or traces of tree nuts.#apr.577.3
u,Yet, it seems very peculiar that these self-proclaimed sufferers aren't dropping dead at work or on the street.#apr.577.4
u,I absolutely agree with citizen_s.#apr.579.0
u,Just an additional  comment, flying either domestic or international has become the most frustrating part of a travel package.#apr.579.1
u,It is difficult to feel human on any carrier these days#apr.579.2
u,and for the carrier to feel that overbooking is a right in order to protect them from losing money is obscene.#apr.579.3
u,Recently, when I checked in for my next day flight, I was alerted that my flight had been overbooked.#apr.579.4
e,This was the first time I have ever been pre-notified of actual overbooking#apr.579.5
u,even though I am aware it is considered by the carrier as merely conducting "business as usual".#apr.579.6
u,Perhaps they can protect any loses by unbundling the amount of oxygen a passenger consumes inflight.#apr.579.7
e,My son is allergic to peanuts.#apr.585.0
e,The last time we flew on an airline that served peanuts  we called ahead and requested that no peanuts be served on our flight.#apr.585.1
u,The airline was extremely accommodating,#apr.585.2
e,but there were peanuts on the floor and between the seats from earlier flights.#apr.585.3
u,For that reason, I don't see banning peanuts on specific flights or a peanut-free buffer zone as real solutions.#apr.585.4
e,We now only fly airlines that don't serve peanuts.#apr.585.5
u,We're okay with Snickers#apr.585.6
n,because the peanuts are less likely to get spilled.#apr.585.7
u,However, this wouldn't be a good solution for those with an inhalation allergy.#apr.585.8
u,Maybe the ban could extend to all foods when there is a specific request.#apr.585.9
u,It seems that Antanagoge is one with ad hominem attacks and false statements.#apr.589.0
u,Nobody said the aircraft or the air was pristine;#apr.589.1
u,it is much cleaner than most public buildings.#apr.589.2
u,That doesn't preclude the fact that peanuts and their remnants are already embedded in the various nooks and crannies of the aircraft and the seat fabrics.#apr.589.3
u,The only people who seem to be "digging in their heels" are those who think that life can and should be risk free.#apr.589.4
u,That's a delusional state of mind.#apr.589.5
n,Facts are facts#apr.589.6
u,and you can't change them,#apr.589.7
u,even though you'd like to do that, and ignore them.#apr.589.8
u,Nobody has died on-board a U.S. airliner from anaphylaxis brought on by peanut allergies,#apr.589.9
u,yet you would have everyone believe that such a fate is certain for everyone who has the potential for a severe reaction.#apr.589.10
u,You also argue that people should not be responsible for their own welfare by taking the appropriate precautions to deal with their allergy; that everyone else should be responsible for them.#apr.589.11
u,There is no snack that would satisfy everyone with a food allergy;#apr.589.12
n,The top 8 food allergens are not the only ones,#apr.589.13
u,so the only true solution would be to ban all food or snacks on all flights.#apr.589.14
u,Instead of living in your fantasy world of no risk, learn to take responsibility for your condition, like most of the population.#apr.589.15
u,If you're unwilling to do that, don't expect anyone else to do it for you.#apr.589.16
u,Broadly - Under the ADA, most, if not all, Americans would be classified as having a disability.#apr.591.0
u,That's unfortunate,#apr.591.1
u,because the language is so loose as to undermine those that actually do have disabilities.#apr.591.2
n,More narrowly, the few good recent studies have shown that of those that self report having food allergies, less than 5% actually do.#apr.591.3
n,Many so-called allergies are based on immunoglobbulin response,#apr.591.4
u,though we know that that is a poor predictor of an actual allergy.#apr.591.5
u,Because few parents want to put their kids through the gold-standard of testing, a blind oral food challenge,#apr.591.6
u,we are now left with the current situation, where an overwhelming majority of supposed allergies are unfounded, a general public is tired of coddled masses, and the few but life-threatening cases are being minimized by a jaded populace.#apr.591.7
u,Allergies  need to be diagnosed using gold-standard testing and rigorous science.#apr.591.8
u,Once again, Antanagoge misrepresents the facts.#apr.595.0
u,Allergies are not considered a disability.#apr.595.1
u,If they were, the entire population would qualify as disabled.#apr.595.2
n,Since nobody has died on a U.S. airline from an allergy to peanuts or tree nuts,#apr.595.3
n,it is safe and accurate to say that the risk is extremely small.#apr.595.4
u,Even smaller is the risk that the plane would crash,#apr.595.5
n,yet people like Antanagoge aren't proposing that we ban air travel due to that possibility.#apr.595.6
u,That's the definition of a hypocrite.#apr.595.7
n,Peanut do not pose any direct threat to the health or safety of anyone,#apr.595.8
n,and there has been no increase in peanut allergies, despite what Ananagoge and groups such as FAAN would like everyone to believe.#apr.595.9
u,People with peanut allergies are responsible for their own well-being.#apr.595.10
u,That means taking Benadryl before boarding a plane, having it with you while flying as well as Epi-pens if prescribed for your specific condition, and wearing a face mask if you're so afraid of certain death from peanut dust being in the air.#apr.595.11
u,If you choose to live your life in fear over imagined risks, you've already given up your right to travel anywhere, by any means.#apr.595.12
u,I don't think there is anything wrong with banning airlines from serving bagged peanuts.#apr.601.0
u,It's an unnecessary risk and you'd think they would have caught onto that already.#apr.601.1
u,Banning passengers from bring their own peanut containing products  is probably too far,#apr.601.2
u,although peanut allergy people should be given the ability to not sit near that person.#apr.601.3
u,It seems like a fair compromise.#apr.601.4
n,Hourihane et al  conducted a gold-standard test  with varying doses of peanut flour - on people previously identified as having strong peanut allergies.#apr.603.0
u,The results were ambiguous:#apr.603.1
n,some folks reacted with higher does ;#apr.603.2
n,none reacted at very low doses;#apr.603.3
n,some self-reported reactions to placebos#apr.603.4
u,which they shouldn't;#apr.603.5
n,and some known to have peanut allergies reported no reaction to high peanut doses.#apr.603.6
n,In another paper,  the same author found that peanut oil poses little risk to patients with known peanut allergies.#apr.603.7
n,Many other papers have found  have shown that those with positive reactions to the food challenge are significantly less than those with positive skin prick reactions .#apr.603.8
u,I don't know of a single study that has shown that airborne peanut matter can cause a severe reaction#apr.603.9
n,maybe one is out there;#apr.603.10
u,if so, can someone post the citation.#apr.603.11
n,In short, the available research shows that confirmed allergies are much less common than folks think, and even people with "known" allergies fail to respond to food challenges.#apr.603.12
u,I think the DOT needs to consider this very carefully when deciding whether to ban peanuts from flights.#apr.603.13
u,It doesn't appear so.#apr.603.14
u,There is indeed plenty wrong with the very idea that airlines should be banned from serving peanuts.#apr.604.0
u,Not only does it shift responsibility for the problems of a very small minority of people onto others,#apr.604.1
u,but it also accomplishes nothing,#apr.604.2
n,as peanuts and pieces of them are already on-board the aircraft.#apr.604.3
u,At the same time, there is negligible risk to peanut allergy sufferers, as evidenced by the data.#apr.604.4
u,If we are to believe the claims of#apr.605.0
u,Antanagoge, then everyone is disabled.#apr.605.1
u,But his arguments are deeply flawed.#apr.605.2
u,Allergies are not disabilities.#apr.605.3
n,People with spinal cord injuries, missing limbs, brain damage, and other abnormal birth defects are disabled;#apr.605.4
u,allergy sufferers are not.#apr.605.5
u,Disabled people aren't looking for pity,#apr.605.6
u,and we shouldn't grant pity to allergy sufferers, either.#apr.605.7
u,The argument that nobody has died due to anaphylaxis on-board a U.S. airline because they avoid flying due to the risk of an allergic reaction is preposterous and unsupported by any data.#apr.605.8
u,Comparisons of anaphylaxis to other risks is completely valid.#apr.605.9
u,The fact that Antanagoge and others would like to ignore them illustrates their mindset perfectly: assuming the worst possible outcome is a certainty, even in the face of scientific data showing it to be extremely rare and unlikely.#apr.605.10
u,Despite Antanagoge's implied claim, there is no peer-reviewed research that shows anything but the fact that peanut allergies are much less widespread and severe than FAAN would like everyone to believe.#apr.605.11
u,If he thinks there's contrary data, he should cite it and provide a link to the full text.#apr.605.12
u,Not being able to serve peanuts on-board an airliner because of a very few who think they're doomed if they're exposed to peanuts is not a reasonable accommodation,#apr.605.13
u,it's a form of terrorism.#apr.605.14
u,Trying to frighten everyone else into bending to your will, thus reinforcing your unfounded beliefs and fears.#apr.605.15
u,There's no inconvenience to peanut allergy sufferers to not eat peanuts,#apr.605.16
u,but there is an inconvenience to everyone else if they can't be served peanuts , or even have their own.#apr.605.17
u,Antanagoge says he believes each individual must take responsibility for managing their condition,#apr.605.18
u,but then he tries to shift that responsibility on to other passengers by claiming that banning peanuts is a reasonable accommodation.#apr.605.19
u,No, it's not.#apr.605.20
u,That's hypocrisy.#apr.605.21
u,There is indeed something wrong with banning peanuts on airlines.#apr.606.0
n,Despite the unfounded fears of certain death if they're exposed to peanuts, no one has died from anaphylaxis from exposure to peanuts, peanut dust, or peanut oil on-board a U.S. airliner.#apr.606.1
u,These are two VERY different issues.#apr.607.0
u,I would be indifferent to rules preventing airlines from serving peanuts#apr.607.1
u,actually, I would welcome it,#apr.607.2
u,because I like the crackers better!.#apr.607.3
u,People who want peanuts can bring their own, easily enough.#apr.607.4
u,No.#apr.607.5
u,And honestly, people would be more effective using market forces to convince airlines to change their menus.#apr.607.6
e,I do have a cousin who legitimately goes into anaphylactic shock at exposure to peanuts.#apr.607.7
u,It's not a joking matter;#apr.607.8
u,I would guess we have fewer complications#apr.607.9
n,because people with peanut issues don't fly.#apr.607.10
n,But this is a minority,#apr.607.11
u,and I would not support a ban on peanuts existing on an airplane.#apr.607.12
u,This reaction isn't actually about peanuts at all.#apr.607.13
e,I've seen these people bring buffets on the plane with them#apr.609.0
u,and you can't control where this was prepared or purchased.#apr.609.1
e,I travel on a plane almost every week, mostly domestic and occasionally internationally.#apr.609.2
u,I find the proposed rules solutions!#apr.609.3
u,Our society is one of tolerance and acceptance provided my issues, problems, conditions don't infringe upon others rights.#apr.609.4
n,Flying is not a constitutional right#apr.609.5
u,it is an opportunity which one may choose to participate in or not.#apr.609.6
u,To single one group of individuals out for protection" at the cost to all others is wrong.#apr.609.7
u,If we are going down this road I would suggest other regulations as well:#apr.609.8
u,Why should mobility restricted people be allowed on planes,#apr.609.9
e,I have flown into China during SARS and Mexico during the H1N1 outbreak,#apr.609.10
e,After flying for over 8 million miles I have seen all of the conditions I describe above.#apr.609.11
e,As a trauma nurse I have been called upon over 10 times to provide critical medical services in flight#apr.609.12
e,but I have never seen a peanut reaction.#apr.609.13
u,To mandate a "peanut-free buffer zone around a passenger" goes against everything our country stands for Independence, Freedom of Choice, Pursuit of happiness, and prohibition of the federal government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law#apr.609.14
e,After typing my comments I read yours#apr.610.0
u,and it was refreshing to see another world traveler with the same thoughts.#apr.610.1
u,I suspect the people who are behind this rule change fly once a year to Disneyland#apr.610.2
u,and they want to change the rules for those of us who actually fly regularly.#apr.610.3
e,I have had a nut allergy for my whole life#apr.615.0
e,and I am not just allergic to peanuts.#apr.615.1
e,I am actually allergic to all nuts.#apr.615.2
u,I can say from personal travel experience that when people eat nuts on an airplane I feel uncomfortable.#apr.615.3
e,I don't have an airborne allergy#apr.615.4
u,but I don't like the smell of peanuts being eaten around and in close proximity to me, especially when the air is being recirculated as it is in an airplane.#apr.615.5
u,I feel that airlines should strive to create the best experience possible#apr.615.6
u,and I don't see how they can do that when I sit in my seat and try to hold my breath for as long as possible in order to avoid the horrible smell of nuts.#apr.615.7
u,On a side note, the fact that they only serve peanuts is extremely inconvenient for me#apr.615.8
u,because then there is no food for me to eat#apr.615.9
e,as I am allergic to it.#apr.615.10
u,I think that an overall ban on all nuts and nut products on airlines should be implemented.#apr.615.11
u,It would be the easiest and most effective option.#apr.615.12
u,I don't think it should matter that airlines are private companies.#apr.615.13
u,That shouldn't be a deciding factor on whether or not they have to deal with people's problems.#apr.615.14
u,Additionally, there are plenty of other snacks that can be offered on planes.#apr.615.15
n,For example, jet blue offers a wide variety of options like chips.#apr.615.16
u,Airlines are extremely inconsiderate when it comes to nut allergies.#apr.615.17
u,I am very cautious and so are my parents#apr.615.18
u,but I have had problems on flights#apr.615.19
e,even though we called in advance to make sure that they knew I had an allergy.#apr.615.20
e,In one instance, I was served a meal on a Lufthansa flight that actually had nuts in it after we had called them multiple times to tell them to have a separate meal prepared for me.#apr.615.21
u,That's just careless behavior that could have resulted in a very severe reaction had I not taken my medication in time.#apr.615.22
u,I think a buffer zone would be ineffective#apr.615.23
u,because I can smell people eating nuts even when they are not next to me.#apr.615.24
u,I hope that something is done to eliminate nuts for airplanes so that others don't have to go through the awful experiences I have had.#apr.615.25
u,Didn't think so.#apr.628.0
u,Nuff said.#apr.628.1
n,An estimated  125 to 150 deaths occur in the United States every year due to food-related anaphylaxis.#apr.632.0
n,About 2 or 3rds of those are thought to be caused by peanuts.#apr.632.1
u,Given that peanut allergy is by far the most prevalent of the food allergies, that proportion would make sense.#apr.632.2
u,The question is not if anyone has died from ingestion of peanuts.#apr.632.3
u,Clearly, the answer is yes, and that has been proven.#apr.632.4
u,The question at hand is whether that merits somehow banning peanuts from air travel.#apr.632.5
u,The buffer zone does not work.#apr.636.0
n,First - if the allergy is severe enough to be airborne - the air in the airplane is circulated through the whole plane, not just the three rows in front and behind you.#apr.636.1
u,It also singles out the person and makes the people in the buffer zone upset that they had to sit there.#apr.636.2
u,I wish it were imagined -#apr.637.0
e,I have a 9-year old with a peanut allergy#apr.637.1
e,and she has had a reaction on a plane due to peanuts being served.#apr.637.2
n,The doctor above understands that the peanut allergy is different from most ofter food allergies because in it life threatening.#apr.637.3
u,I don't understand how not being able to eat peanuts for a few hours out of your life is worth putting another life at risk.#apr.637.4
u,I would love the links to those studies also.#apr.641.0
e,I unfortunately have seen my daughter have an allergic reaction to inhalation of peanut dust twice-once on an airplane and once in a restaurant we entered before we were aware of the peanut shells all over the floor.#apr.641.1
e,Her face swelled#apr.641.2
e,and her eyes completely swelled shut-something I would label as a serious reaction.#apr.641.3
u,She was too young for it to be from stress.#apr.641.4
e,I don't have any studies to back it up - just what I witnessed.#apr.641.5
u,I don't think the DOT should monitor what each person brings onto the flight - there is a big difference if 150 people open up peanut packs verses 5-10 people bringing on their own snacks.#apr.641.6
u,If you have the allergy you do need to be prepared with medications and clean your area with wipes or cover your seat.#apr.641.7
n,There already is a cure;#apr.645.0
n,it just isn't available yet.#apr.645.1
n,No, the DOT believes SEVERE peanut allergies count as a disability,#apr.646.0
u,but their belief means nothing.#apr.646.1
n,Congress has the final say as to whether or not they agree and want to continue funding for such a position.#apr.646.2
n,A search of Westlaw came up with no Federal court rulings in favor of such a position.#apr.646.3
u,Banning peanuts isn't a solution at all,#apr.646.4
n,since the aircraft is already contaminated with peanuts, peanut oils, and peanut dust in the fabric of the seats;#apr.646.5
n,the only way to get rid of it would be to remove all the seats and the sub-floor and replace them both.#apr.646.6
n,That's not only economically unfeasible for the airline,#apr.646.7
u,but the cost per fight would increase dramatically.#apr.646.8
u,But the fact that the plane is already contaminated and nobody has died from their proclaimed severe peanut allergy is evidence that their condition isn't nearly as dire and they believe, or that they would have everyone else believe.#apr.646.9
e,I did suggest wearing masks before,#apr.646.10
u,but one particular person ignored that idea,#apr.646.11
u,perhaps because they thought the very idea was beneath them, or somehow inconsiderate of their condition.#apr.646.12
u,Either way, it's indicative that they don't want to take responsibility for their own condition and want society to cater to their fears and prejudices.#apr.646.13
u,Try a Google search.#apr.651.0
n,I very quickly found a link to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America that contends that under both the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974 that allergies and asthma are both recognized disabilities.#apr.651.1
n,Again, "breathing" is defined as a "major life function"#apr.651.2
u,and it's pretty hard to argue that completely closed airways through anaphylaxis do not constitute a "substantial limiting".#apr.651.3
n,Whether or not the federal government has specifically ruled on this, I don't know.#apr.651.4
u,If the courts simply haven't addressed this yet, which, frankly, seems unlikely considering how many organizations and websites I've found that reference successful cases of workplace discrimination under the ADA for individuals with allergies, the fact is, when they do, they almost certainly will  recognize this as a conditional disability qualifying under the ADA for the reasons above.#apr.651.5
u,As I understand it, the concern is not over trace amounts of oil and dust that have been absorbed or trapped by fabric,#apr.651.6
u,it's over the clouds of fresh dust that are released when a package is opened and dispersed throughout the plane via the central air system or from the overhead air jets.#apr.651.7
n,The oils in the fabric will most likely have been absorbed down below the surface level#apr.651.8
u,and the dust trapped by the fabric is unlikely to be dislodged in significant quantities short of someone actively beating the seats as one would a rug.#apr.651.9
u,If you've ever seen images of fabric through a microscope you'll understand why it takes such force to dislodge captured particulates.#apr.651.10
u,I'm not sure why you continue to question the potential severity of peanut allergies.#apr.651.11
n,There's a very large body of medical documentation establishing, quite thoroughly, just how severe these allergies can be#apr.651.12
n,and others on this site have mentioned that nut allergies account for the majority of food-allergy caused death.#apr.651.13
u,Whether or not anyone on an airplane has died from this, YET, is irrelevant.#apr.651.14
u,Perhaps we've just been lucky so far.#apr.651.15
n,From what I've gathered reading the comments here, people with peanut allergies severe enough to warrant immediate medical attention, because of their fears, do not generally fly on airplanes.#apr.651.16
u,Very small population to begin with and widespread self-imposed flying ban = No deaths, YET, on an airplane.#apr.651.17
u,However, the whole point of the ADA is to ensure that Americans with disabilities do not HAVE to forgo things such as flight because of their disability.#apr.651.18
u,The problem, right now, isn't people dying of anaphylaxis on airplanes,#apr.651.19
u,it's American citizens being unable, because of their disability, to participate in a normal, every day activity that they otherwise would be able to, with minor accommodation.#apr.651.20
u,I do agree with you that banning peanuts  on flights is not the right way to go.#apr.651.21
u,Instead of worrying about one particular person and what motivation they may or may not have had in ignoring your first recommendation of it, why not help the overall cause here by continuing to advocate that airlines provide, upon request, masks, gloves, and cleanroom suits so that those who DO take responsibility for their own condition can enjoy the freedom air travel provides the rest of us US citizens.#apr.651.22
n,An Epi-Pen will not stop the reaction, unless the allergen is removed, or the patient is removed from the air containing the allergen.#apr.654.0
n,This is impossible in the confined space of an airplane.#apr.654.1
n,There is no alternate transportation for international flights.#apr.654.2
u,And some people may have to fly#apr.654.3
n,because governments require them to be certain places at certain times .#apr.654.4
n,There are no masks that stop proteins.#apr.654.5
u,They itch.#apr.656.0
u,Try having your airway swell shut and fill with mucus.#apr.656.1
n,You are dead in 3 minutes.#apr.656.2
u,Your claim is specious at best.#apr.659.0
n,You can't be exposed to an allergen that is wrapped, and therefore not exposed to the air.#apr.659.1
u,If you really believe the DOT would let anyone cause any claimed allergen from a flight, you are daft.#apr.659.2
n,Everyone is allergic to something,#apr.659.3
u,so that would mean an empty plane, as well as an undue burden on other passengers and the airlines.#apr.659.4
u,It's not going to happen,#apr.659.5
u,so you might as well stay home and live behind that plastic sheeting of yours.#apr.659.6
n,Air is not recirculated on airplanes.#apr.659.7
u,That's a myth that you need to abandon.#apr.659.8
n,The air on-board is cleaner than most public buildings.#apr.659.9
u,If you want your own air supply, bring it from home,#apr.659.10
n,since you're not breathing the air inside your house or apartment.#apr.659.11
u,Good luck with that.#apr.659.12
n,Tiffany 462, an Epi-Pen stops the reaction for a few minutes at most.#apr.660.0
n,During that time, the allergen must be removed,#apr.660.1
n,or the allergic person must be removed from the allergen.#apr.660.2
n,And it is dangerous to use a second Epi-Pen soon after the first one.#apr.660.3
n,It is not a cure, but a stopgap measure to save life.#apr.660.4
n,There is probably not an airport within reach during the time the Epi-Pen works.#apr.660.5
u,Your nonsense has to stop.#apr.660.6
n,Some people are required to fly, often by government decree .#apr.660.7
n,A federal court case in which an airport and airlines were tried for non-compliance with the ADA.#apr.663.0

n,The Air Carrier Access Act- a non-ADA body of regulations governing treatment of disabled passengers on commercial airlines.#apr.663.2
u,Safety and peace of mind for allergy sufferers without inconveniencing anyone else- Priceless#apr.663.3
u,I think this is way beyond necessary.#apr.664.0
u,I do feel for the small minority of people with allergies#apr.664.1
e,but I have not heard of anyone dying on a plane because of peanuts.#apr.664.2
u,PLEASE!#apr.664.3
u,This is getting really out of hand.#apr.664.4
u,After peanuts next thing will be strawberries or shell fish.#apr.664.5
u,This is a small special interest group.#apr.664.6
u,This is not necessary.#apr.664.7
u,An outright ban on all commercial flights is unjustifiable and would be strongly fought by the peanut industry, congress, and others.#apr.665.0
u,Follow existing models.#apr.665.1
n,For example, in schools across America, there are peanut-free classrooms and peanut-free lunch tables in cafeterias.#apr.665.2
n,Peanut-free schools in whole are rare to non-existent.#apr.665.3
u,If you mandate the offering of peanut-free flights, airlines are likely to simply phase out peanuts from their menus.#apr.665.4
u,For a peanut-free flight, it is not enough to simply ban handing out peanut snacks.#apr.665.5
u,All passengers must be told and screened for peanuts and peanut-containing products.#apr.665.6
u,Those PBandJ sandwiches are ubiquitous --#apr.665.7
n,I'm sure at least one passenger has one on most every flight.#apr.665.8
u,So yes, provide a safe, peanut-free environment,#apr.665.9
u,but don't go overboard and beyond what is necessary and customary to accommodate the disability.#apr.665.10
u,I feel bad for the peanut industry.#apr.665.11
u,All this negativity translates to economic losses.#apr.665.12
u,I would encourage you not to single out peanuts but rather all allergyns.#apr.665.13
u,Allow people to specify their allergyn and severity, and then either make the area or entire flight free of the allergyn including informing and restricting what passengers can board with --#apr.665.14
u,oh, and they should wash their hands well to remove the oils or allergyns.#apr.665.15
u,At issue is making the airlines responsible for clearly indicating all fees associated with a flight.#apr.668.0
n,When searching for a flight with Internet search engines they compare the basic price.#apr.668.1
n,Airlines call it "a la carte" pricing and think passengers like the idea.#apr.668.2
u,Well, we don't.#apr.668.3
u,Give me one price and let me check baggage, board the flight and sit near a window.#apr.668.4
u,Don't nickle and dime me.#apr.668.5
u,AND ensure if you are going to charge the additional fees that I can know what they are up front and very clearly.#apr.668.6
u,DOT needs to ensure all fees necessary to fly are upfront to the passengers.#apr.668.7
e,My child has a fairly severe peanut allergy.#apr.670.0
e,Although she has never had a reaction on an airplane,#apr.670.1
e,she did have a reaction to the dust or smell of peanut products we disposed of when we first found out she had this allergy .#apr.670.2
u,Because of that, I know that reactions to airborne peanut particles are real#apr.670.3
u,and it raises concerns for me about what happens in the small, enclosed environment of an airplane.#apr.670.4
u,Reading the comments posted, I am surprised at the cavalier attitude of many.#apr.670.5
u,The idea that those with peanut allergies should take personal responsibility for themselves is of course reasonable.#apr.670.6
u,However, just saying that they should carry their epi-pens and other medications with them and deal with whatever reaction may arise misses the point.#apr.670.7
n,First, Epi-pens do not always reverse a serious reaction,#apr.670.8
n,and so even with the proper medication available death is still a possible outcome.#apr.670.9
n,Second, even if the epi-pen reverses the reaction, having the reaction and having to use the epi-pen both are serious health matters not to be taken lightly and may have consequences in their own right, especially if multiple doses of epinephrine are required.#apr.670.10
u,Also, while this is a disability of sorts,#apr.670.11
u,the comparison to a person in a wheelchair is not apt.#apr.670.12
n,If a person needs a wheelchair to get around, he or she can live without that wheelchair.#apr.670.13
n,There is no question whether the absence of the wheelchair by itself may result in that person's death.#apr.670.14
n,In contrast, in the case of peanut allergies the presence of peanuts in the environment can be life threatening.#apr.670.15
u,The slippery slope argument used by others would make sense if there weren't clear ways to draw the line in this case.#apr.670.16
u,There are.#apr.670.17
n,Peanuts are the number one anaphylaxis inducing food substance in the world.#apr.670.18
n,There are others,#apr.670.19
u,but none come close to peanuts.#apr.670.20
u,The suggestion that other bans on other things that are not life threatening would follow is slope that don't find the least bit slippery!#apr.670.21
u,Finally, if we consider this as a question of rights, then we have to consider that one person's rights will often be in competition or conflict with another's.#apr.670.22
u,This is such a case.#apr.670.23
u,Your right to eat what you like versus the allergic person's right to an environment that is not life-threatening.#apr.670.24
u,I suggest that more "essential" right should trump the lesser.#apr.670.25
n,If cannot eat what you want, you can still live.#apr.670.26
u,The other side of any right is the obligations it imposes on others.#apr.670.27
u,In this case, the allergic person still has the obligation to take reasonable precautions,#apr.670.28
u,but others have an obligation not to create a hazardous environment for that person just so they can enjoy their peanut butter sandwiches.#apr.670.29
u,Howie, you really need to try out this "Google" thing sometime!#apr.672.0
n,You'll find multiple reports from reputable news outlets, even links to some newspaper articles#apr.672.1
u,Seriously, try it out buddy.#apr.672.2
u,The fact that you weren't affected in any way during flight is evidence that your fears are irrational and unfounded.#apr.680.0
u,Instead of worrying about a possibility that is so remote, get some therapy to deal with your fears.#apr.680.1
u,They are unhealthy for you and everyone around you.#apr.680.2
u,There are a LOT of those out there.#apr.686.0
n,Bottom line here is that there are a lot of things that can potentially kill someone who is allergic to them.#apr.687.0
u,If you ban peanuts or peanut products then what about all of the other things like latex or perfume, etc.#apr.687.1
u,Yet if you ban every product that could potentially cause a fatal or near fatal allergic reaction then you make flying impractical.#apr.687.2
e,As I suffer from a severe peanut allergy,#apr.688.0
u,I am also for the banning of peanut products on airplanes.#apr.688.1
u,I can assure you that this is a very important issue;#apr.688.2
e,I myself had reactions to airborne peanuts while on airplanes.#apr.688.3
u,This makes traveling by air very risky if not impossible.#apr.688.4
u,It is important that the general public be made aware of the lifestyle restrictions that this situation puts on those who suffer from the allergy.#apr.688.5
u,For example, being unable to travel by air can have a significant impact on professional development and career success.#apr.688.6
u,I am sure that we can all agree that for someone with a disability to be unnecessarily restricted in such a way is unjust.#apr.688.7
u,As a mother of a child who had a  mild reaction to someone else's peanuts on a plane, I would like to say that as a physical disability this should be treated as any other.#apr.692.0
n,People in wheelchairs are given ramps and special treatment#apr.692.1
u,which is also somewhat inconvenient to other passengers,#apr.692.2
u,For those who say all possible allergens would be banned, they obviously do not understand that only a couple of allergens  travel through the air in dust form.#apr.692.3
u,I cannot comprehend people who are not willing to give up one certain snack-food for a couple of hours for the safety of others.#apr.692.4
u,There are so many laws to protect the handicapped that I don't understand how this is even a debate.#apr.692.5
u,Peanuts should be banned on planes.#apr.692.6
u,I am a firm believer that people should not put themselves in harms way...#apr.703.0
u,that being said, if a person wants to do something that may cause them harm, then need to take precautions to mitigate the harmful effects, or not partake in the activity.#apr.703.1
u,If you want to fly and have an allergy, you should insure that you have medication available and wear a mask, gloves and whatever else you need to protect yourself.#apr.703.2
u,One percent reported incidents is hardly enough to attack an entire industry, be it the Airlines or the Peanut industries.#apr.703.3
n,No, you didn't have a reaction to airborne peanuts:#apr.705.0
n,they're heavier than air,#apr.705.1
n,so they can't be airborne.#apr.705.2
n,Peanut dust could be airborne,#apr.705.3
u,but unless you were not taking any precautions for your condition, you weren't at any great risk.#apr.705.4
n,Nobody has ever died from anaphylaxis due to peanut allergies on a U.S. based airline.#apr.705.5
u,That is irrefutable evidence that the actual risk is so small as to be non-existent.#apr.705.6
u,Your lifestyle isn't be restricted by your allergy,#apr.705.7
u,it's being restricted by you living in fear.#apr.705.8
u,You've taken the worst case scenario and assumed it to be a certainty,#apr.705.9
u,when in fact it's not.#apr.705.10
u,Nothing is stopping you from traveling by air except your irrational fears.#apr.705.11
u,There are far greater risks in many other things you do every day,#apr.705.12
u,yet you're somehow not worried about those.#apr.705.13
u,That's what we call selective disability.#apr.705.14
u,You're not disabled;#apr.705.15
u,that's an excuse you use to shift responsibility for your allergy to other people.#apr.705.16
u,I think the large majority of the population doesn't understand that a severe peanut allergy is unlike other allergy.#apr.706.0
u,Many people think "oh I have allergies-I take an antihistamine when I get itchy or feel sick".#apr.706.1
n,People with  a severe allergy can die from a reaction to the peanut protein in the closed confines of a plane with recirculated air.#apr.706.2
u,This is not an irrational fear, but rather based in the reality that you can take all the proper precautions,#apr.706.3
u,but there is nothing you can do if the peanut protein is in the air on a plane.#apr.706.4
u,It's not like you can go outside for fresh air.#apr.706.5
n,An epi-pen is only a stop gap solution.#apr.706.6
n,It lasts for 15-20 minutes and allows the sufferer time to get to an emergency room for further treatment.#apr.706.7
e,We first discovered that my son's allergy to peanuts, included air born exposure while flying on a plane.#apr.706.8
e,He was 5 years old and asleep and started scratching his face,#apr.706.9
e,which also began to swell.#apr.706.10
e,I looked to the back of the plane and discovered that the stewards were passing out peanuts,#apr.706.11
e,which everyone was popping open.#apr.706.12
e,I asked her to stop immediately, which she did.#apr.706.13
e,I gave my son Benedryl#apr.706.14
u,and fortunately this sufficed-this time.#apr.706.15
u,We were very lucky.#apr.706.16
u,It is terrifying to be mid-flight and think that your child or loved one could die like this.#apr.706.17
u,It is also very disheartening to read comments from people who feel that their freedom is impinged upon by not being allowed to eat a certain food for the length of a flight.#apr.706.18
u,It seems a minor inconvenience to be asked to refrain from a food preference for such a short time in order to save another's life.#apr.706.19
n,A peanut free zone will not work because of the air born peanut protein in recirculated air.#apr.706.20
n,If many passengers decided they were going to bring a peanut containing candy bar on the plane, this too could create a serious allergic reaction.#apr.706.21
u,I also think that the airlines should be required to carry epi-pens and an emergency kit to be prepared to treat a variety of  emergencies,#apr.706.22
n,since once up in the air we are captive to what is available.#apr.706.23
n,The reason nobody ever died from an anaphylactic peanut reaction on a flight is because the parents of children with this allergy go to great lengths to make sure the flight is peanut free and often meet with the disdain of flight personnel when reminding them on boarding of the need for a peanut free flight and to make an announcement to not eat peanut products on the plane.#apr.706.24
u,Banning peanuts on a fight seems like a minor inconvenience and not a lot to ask to save a life.#apr.706.25
u,The only way the rule can be effective is to ban peanuts and peanut products from all flights.#apr.706.26
n,The air on-board an airliner is not recirculated,#apr.716.0
u,so you might as well abandon that excuse;#apr.716.1
u,it doesn't work for you.#apr.716.2
n,The reason nobody ever died from an anaphylactic peanut reaction on a flight is because the parents of children with this allergy go to great lengths to make sure the flight is peanut free...#apr.716.3
u,Yet another false claim unsupported by the evidence.#apr.716.4
u,The reason this hasn't happened is due to one fact only:#apr.716.5
n,the risk is extremely small so as to be statistically non-existent.#apr.716.6
u,You cling to irrational fears to support your desire, rather than reason and evidence.#apr.716.7
u,Unless your child has been medically tested and diagnosed with a peanut allergy,#apr.716.8
u,there is no way to know whether or not he has one, much less the severity.#apr.716.9
u,You'd rather live your life in constant fear of things that are so unlikely, thus creating unhealthy anxiety for you and your child.#apr.716.10
u,You need psychological help.#apr.716.11
u,I don't believe that a peanut free zone would suffice,#apr.717.0
u,but it is better than nothing.#apr.717.1
u,However, I prefer having those with allergies disclose them prior to flight and then ban them on that flight.#apr.717.2
e,Southwest Airlines has done this for us in the past#apr.717.3
u,and it worked out quite well.#apr.717.4
u,Of course, as I said before, I think banning them outright makes more sense.#apr.717.5
u,Actually, JJMurray, I would support banning such items from being used or taken out during flights,#apr.718.0
n,given that they are capable of doing so simply being circulated in the air.#apr.718.1
n,You're right that peanuts are not the only items that can do this,#apr.718.2
u,but the list of items that are well known to cause such reactions in this way is not that long.#apr.718.3
u,And I would challenge you to find any reason why a person couldn't go without them for the duration of any flight.#apr.718.4
e,Ed - I got peanuts served on 2 flights this summer.#apr.720.0
u,But the substance of the debate goes far beyond simple bags of peanuts.#apr.720.1
n,Many of the commenters indicate they want full bans on any peanut-containing products, including those brought on board by passengers.#apr.720.2
u,Which means this not puts the onus on the passenger to check the label of any food they bring on board, and eliminate any food that contains peanuts, is made with peanut oil, or was manufactured in a plant that also processes peanuts.#apr.720.3
u,Because banning airlines from distributing peanuts doesn't address the issue -#apr.720.4
u,only a full ban on any peanut product would suffice.#apr.720.5
u,Clearly, you can't ban passengers from bringing energy bars that may contain trace amounts of peanuts.#apr.720.6
u,Howie, You have no idea what you are talking about.#apr.723.0
u,They are not mostly imagined#apr.723.1
u,and it is a serious issue.#apr.723.2
u,If you can't survive hours or days without peanuts then that is your problem#apr.723.3
u,and if you think it is that much of an inconvenience then maybe you should see somebody to deal with your own lack of discipline.#apr.723.4
u,Great comment.#apr.724.0
e,I am a parent of a multi-food allergy 6 year old.#apr.724.1
u,We are careful on what airlines we travel,#apr.724.2
e,we carry multiple epi-pens,#apr.724.3
e,we wipe down the seats before we let her sit down, etc...#apr.724.4
u,Peanuts or Tree Nuts are worse then other food allergens#apr.724.5
n,because they can be airborne#apr.724.6
u,which is why the recirculated air on airplanes is a problem.#apr.724.7
u,I am always nervous when are on a flight especially if we are going overseas#apr.724.8
u,Amen.#apr.737.0
u,Well said.#apr.737.1
n,Actually, Howie, vomiting IS a part of an allergic reaction.#apr.738.0
n,Allergies also do tend to run in families although not necessarily of the same variety.#apr.738.1
n,Kids with allergies tend to get tested by lots of people during the course of their lives doctors and allergist alike.#apr.738.2
n,Food challenges , skin prick tests , and blood test  are the top three methods of determining true allergies.#apr.738.3
u,Living in a world surrounded by lack of awareness tends to deprive them of enjoyable things in life far more then avoiding the offending food.#apr.738.4
u,My concern is that the peanut ban, if it only bans airlines from serving peanut products, may create a false sense of security for allergy sufferers.#apr.739.0
n,Passengers may still carry peanut products, such as peanut butter granola bars, peanut butter cookies, or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on the airplane with them.#apr.739.1
u,So really, any meaningful ban would have to include passengers from bringing peanut products on the airplane.#apr.739.2
u,Maybe the answer is to designate certain flights as peanut-free.#apr.740.0
u,That way, the families that just love love their PBandJ can take the regular flights,#apr.740.1
u,and those passengers who either have peanut allergies themselves or who are willing, for the sake of others, to make conscientious choices when packing their in-flight meals and snacks can take the peanut-free flights.#apr.740.2
n,What is really telling in this entire discussion, is that each of the supposed allergy sufferers  start off by saying I or my child has a life threatening allergy etc., and then describe an incident where they were exposed to the supposed allergen and either nothing happened, or a MILD reaction occurred.#apr.744.0
e,Several times I see - 'I got nervous through  the whole flight because I could smell peanuts', or, 'he broke out in hives and I was terrified', or itchy eyes and scratchy throat, etc.#apr.744.1
u,Not one of these posters is mentioning an actual serious reaction that led to death or extended hospitalization.#apr.744.2
u,Hives, itchy eyes, scratchy throat - all unpleasant, but hardly life threatening.#apr.744.3
n,In a response to one of my earlier posts someone said that 100 to 200 people die of food allergies each year.#apr.744.4
n,No citation or support is offered for this ##apr.744.5
u,so its accuracy can only be speculated.#apr.744.6
n,The reply goes on to say 'the majority of those are caused by peanuts' - once again without citation.#apr.744.7
n,Even if these #s were accurate, this is not a statistically significant portion of the population.#apr.744.8
u,There is a huge gap here between perception and reality.#apr.744.9
u,As Mr. Mulder correctly pointed out, when you are told over and over that peanuts will kill you, you may well have a reaction when you believe you have been exposed to them.#apr.744.10
n,The problem is, it is a stress induced reaction , NOT an allergy.#apr.744.11
n,The fact is, numerous peer reviewed studies have found serious food allergies to be incredibly rare, and life threatening reactions to be so rare as to approach statistical ZERO.#apr.744.12
n,The majority of self-reported allergics who have been actually studied do not react when given the supposed allergen in a controlled environment.#apr.744.13
u,So, if actual science determines that there is a real risk to a statistically significant portion of the population, I will gladly surrender my peanuts.#apr.744.14
u,The peanut people are correct about one thing,#apr.744.15
u,my enjoyment of a snack is not more important than actual lives.#apr.744.16
n,The thing is, it has not been proved, has not even been reasonably implied that my peanuts are putting ANYONE at risk.#apr.744.17
u,As a traveler with no peanut allergy, I am nevertheless sympathetic to the problems that can arise.#apr.745.0
u,However, I think that either a complete restriction or a buffer zone should not be an airline responsibility.#apr.745.1
n,One cannot sterilize the environment of all dangerous or potentially dangerous items or conditions.#apr.745.2
u,I believe that responsibility resides with the allergy-sensitive person, to make the decision on exposure, and have the medical items needed to deal with individual exposures.#apr.745.3
n,Certainly, airlines could carry Epi-pens,#apr.745.4
u,but the allergic individual should rely on their own medication to control an allergic reaction.#apr.745.5
u,I believe, that NO regulation should be adopted on this issue.#apr.745.6
u,Your child had an unpleasant reaction.#apr.763.0
u,NOT a dangerous one.#apr.763.1
n,This is not a life or death issue,#apr.763.2
u,it is only a matter of comfort.#apr.763.3
u,Obviously I don't want anyone to die.#apr.765.0
u,With all the hysteria being spouted by you and others, it seems like this board should be full of heartbreaking tales of dead loved ones.#apr.765.1
n,I was simply making the point that those tales are not here because it hasn't happened,#apr.765.2
u,because THERE IS NO RISK!#apr.765.3
u,The Airlines seem protective of their international flight passengers so they are not charged for baggage while the US carriers pretty much acted as a monopoly to apply fees to domestic air travelers.#apr.769.0
u,Once they got enough airlines to sign on to the practice there is no stopping them short of regulation.#apr.769.1
n,A poll on CNN showed the baggage fee as the most hated fee for consumers.#apr.769.2
u,It is not only airborne particles that are problematical, it is also the crumbs, whole peanuts that "get away" from the passenger , and residue left behind on seats, seat belts, floors, tray tables and other surfaces.#apr.783.0
n,Ingestion or contact can trigger severe reactions.#apr.783.1
u,Take peanuts and items containing peanuts or peanut butter  off of airplanes.#apr.783.2
u,This is all the airlines need to do.#apr.783.3
n,Most airlines already have a suitable replacement snack.#apr.783.4
n,Anyone with a severe allergy already has EpiPens or other medications.#apr.783.5
u,Airlines need not provide these.#apr.783.6
u,Take peanuts off of planes.#apr.783.7
u,Safety first.#apr.783.8
n,Just to clarify - peanuts are absolutely NOT banned in schools.#apr.788.0
e,My children eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches twice a week#apr.788.1
e,and they are served in the cafeteria daily.#apr.788.2
e,This is a public school in the Chicago suburbs - K through 8.#apr.788.3
n,It is my understanding that non-peanut related items made in a facility that produces peanut snacks are more likely to be a problem for peanut allergy sufferers if the product ingested as opposed to simply coming in contact with.#apr.790.0
e,The basis for my understanding comes from visits to allergy-specializing doctors concerning my 4-year old daughter's food allergies.#apr.790.1
e,I have also attended lectures from immunologists in an effort to determine precisely what is a threat to my daughter and how large of a threat a particular item may be.#apr.790.2
u,The ban should include peanuts, products containing peanuts , and products derived from peanuts .#apr.790.3
n,So, PracticalJo is saying that no matter what she does, her daughter always gets hives, itches, and sneezes while flying, supposedly from peanut allergens.#apr.792.0
u,That is pure nonsense.#apr.792.1
u,If her daughter had taken Benadryl before boarding the plane, it prevents those very things from happening.#apr.792.2
u,Even so, there's no reason to remove peanuts from planes for the very minute chance that someone will suffer anaphalactic shock due to peanut allergies.#apr.792.3
u,You can't make all risks go away,#apr.792.4
u,so there's no point in trying.#apr.792.5
n,And you cannot remove peanut allergens from an airliner unless you take out all the seats and the subfloor,#apr.792.6
u,which the airlines aren't going to do.#apr.792.7
u,That would also drive up the cost for a flight dramatically, to the point that the average person cannot afford to fly anymore.#apr.792.8
u,Instead of living your life in a state of fear over something that is so unlikely to happen, get professional help for yourself.#apr.792.9
u,You're not doing your child any favors by creating needless anxiety for them everywhere they go.#apr.792.10
u,Actually, I do know what I'm talking about.#apr.793.0
n,Celiac disease and gluten allergies are two different things.#apr.793.1
u,The fact that you don't understand that illustrates your ignorance of the issue at hand.#apr.793.2
u,The problem is that we have an irrational group of people who claim to suffer from severe peanut allergies,#apr.794.0
u,who are trying to impose their desire to ban peanuts and other nuts from being served by airlines under the guise of safety.#apr.794.1
u,But they can point to no evidence that their worst, unfounded fears have ever happened on any U.S. airliner,#apr.794.2
u,so they hype their claims even more, hoping their tiny minority will gain favor.#apr.794.3
u,In the process, they refuse to deal with their irrational fears, and point blame at everyone and everything for their "inability" to fly, even going so far as to claim it's a disability.#apr.794.4
u,There's no disability here at all.#apr.794.5
u,The simple fact is that these people want to shift their responsibility for their own well-being onto others, and they'll use any means they can to justify their goal.#apr.794.6
u,The simplest solution would be to ban peanut allergy sufferers from flying.#apr.794.7
n,Everyone is allergic to something,#apr.796.0
u,so using your reasoning, we'd be on a plane with no food, along with some other things,#apr.796.1
u,which would make it a very unpleasant flight for everyone involved.#apr.796.2
u,Banning peanuts will not protect anyone;#apr.796.3
u,they're already onboard the aircraft, along with peanut dust in the fabric of the seats.#apr.796.4
n,The fact that nobody has ever died from anaphylactic shock due to peanut allergies on a U.S. airliner is clear evidence that the risk is so remote as to be non-existent.#apr.796.5
u,Instead of imagining the worst-case scenario and assuming it to be a certainty, try dealing with your irrational fears and live your life.#apr.796.6
u,If it was really as risky as you seem to believe, then you wouldn't ever leave your home.#apr.796.7
u,I can't believe there is any debate on this at all,#apr.811.0
n,since there are no emergency rooms at 40,000 feet!#apr.811.1
u,It should be obvious to those for whom passenger safety is a priority that all peanut products should be banned from aircraft.#apr.811.2
u,Standard disclaimer I am one of those who is severely allergic to peanuts -#apr.811.3
e,for me exposure to even the slightest bit of dust is potentially fatal.#apr.811.4
e,I don't have to eat them.#apr.811.5
e,Once, I went into Anaphylaxis when a co-worker from a previous shift left some peanut oil and residue on a shared workstation.#apr.811.6
n,Remember, aircraft at altitude generally pressurize the cabin to 10,000 feet and when hundreds of those little bags packed at sea level are opened,#apr.811.7
n,the pressure difference propels the dust straight into the air...#apr.811.8
n,which I should remind everyone is not fresh air from outside but instead recirculated cabin air,#apr.811.9
n,so the offensive particles remain.#apr.811.10
n,There's no air exchange on a commercial aircraft,#apr.811.11
u,you're stuck with what you've got#apr.811.12
e,and yes I do carry two epi-pens#apr.811.13
n,but as others have already stated an epi-pen is only effective for 10-15 minutes#apr.811.14
u,and when deployed you must also report to an emergency room asap!#apr.811.15
e,I have a friend who is allergic to a different food item#apr.811.16
e,but she hit her epi-pen once and had a stroke!#apr.811.17
n,Epi-pens are not without risk.#apr.811.18
u,I'd much rather not use mine.#apr.811.19
u,In fact, I'd rather not die in an aircraft because some selfish "personal rights" idiot wanted his bag of peanuts.#apr.811.20
u,Policies on all of these issues should be uniform and transparent.#apr.814.0
u,Nothing is worse that trying to "negotiate" a situation with a peeved ticket agent in a crowded and stress-filled airport.#apr.814.1
e,I recently took a Delta flight into JFK with a fairly tight connection.#apr.814.2
e,We actually arrived a bit ahead of the scheduled time,#apr.814.3
e,but there was no gate available#apr.814.4
e,so Delta parked our incoming flight on their tarmac and bussed us to the gate in a Delta bus.#apr.814.5
e,Unfortunately, it took the bus so long to pick us up from the flight that virtually no one on the flight was able to make their connections.#apr.814.6
e,Then, when I learned that the next flight was six hours later, the agent refused even a meal voucher for the delay.#apr.814.7
e,the delay wasn't Delta's fault#apr.814.8
n,of course, whether something is the airline's fault is, you guessed it, defined by the airline itself . . . great#apr.814.9
e,At one point, I asked whether I could cancel the trip and get a refund.#apr.814.10
e,The agent gave me a dirty look and pointed me to a phone line across the lobby.#apr.814.11
u,With clear and balanced rules, I could have read them, known my rights, and dealt with things efficiently rather than having to be at an information disadvantage.#apr.814.12
u,PracticalJo is the one who is uninformed.#apr.815.0
n,Reputable sources will confirm that actual severe food allergies of any kind are extremely rare, and life threatening ones are nearly non-existent.#apr.815.1
n,There are certainly not "millions of children" who could die from peanut exposure.#apr.815.2
u,As far as speaking to someone who suffers several severe food allergies, I've spoken to a few who CLAIM that status - hypochondriacs all.#apr.815.3
n,These allergies are mostly imagined.#apr.815.4
u,There are intolerances to various foods, that is not an allergy and will cause discomfort but not death.#apr.815.5
u,Even those with actual allergies are not in any danger of dying - just mild discomfort.#apr.815.6
n,Hives and itching are not life threatening conditions.#apr.815.7
u,The point is not that I 'need' peanuts.#apr.815.8
u,The point is I refuse to make accommodations for baseless fears.#apr.815.9
n,There is not one person on this board reporting an actual death.#apr.815.10
u,If there were any actual risk, the survivors of a peanut victim would be all over this board telling the tragic story.#apr.815.11
u,Instead what we get are a bunch of wild-eyed claims without any basis in fact.#apr.815.12
u,It would be more valid to claim that airlines must increase leg room to avoid deaths due to deep vein thrombosis-which has actually happened.#apr.815.13
u,Here is a good place to begin your research#apr.816.0
n,Mount Sinai Medical School and the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute is one of, if not the, premier institute in the country working to solve the food allergy mystery.#apr.816.1
n,Indeed, millions of Americans have food allergies#apr.816.2
n,and unfortunately many people die each year due to allergic reactions to certain foods.#apr.816.3
e,Personally, we have only had one ER trip to save our daughter's life due to a reaction.#apr.816.4
u,I hope we never have to go through that again.#apr.816.5
u,Good insights rdgeiger,#apr.817.0
u,I wonder, do airlines get the amount of timely info they need, say... from the tower or the like;#apr.817.1
n,Or, as I suspect, the airlines simply board -- then make a mad dash for the tarmac with little to no communication with the tower.#apr.817.2
u,create a "virtual" remote terminal where passengers could "pretend" to board the plane which would in turn allow their plane to enter into a "virtual" tarmac line.#apr.817.3
u,Then, when the weather clears, the airlines would be instructed, from the tower, to board "for real" and enter the line based on their "virtual" position.#apr.817.4
u,This would allow  passengers the use of the existing  or  original gate as the new temporary "holding" area -- as per your suggestion.#apr.817.5
u,I know, require each gate to remain available and open until that particular plane actually takes flight.#apr.817.6
u,And I'm assuming the agent didn't volunteer a number of a powerful 'dispute resolution' manager.#apr.818.0
u,Hey, you could have at least had fun with this rude agent by using the pointed at phone to call up 'that' agent across the lobby and proceed to ask your reasonable questions again.#apr.818.1
u,At least then your agent would have a legitimate reason display the "dirty" look. lol#apr.818.2
u,I think that the rules should apply to all carriers - domestic and international carriers included.#apr.828.0
u,I recommend reviewing the FAA flight regulations that a carrier flys under  e.g. FAA FAR Part 135 or 136. etc. rather than the size of aircraft.#apr.828.1
u,Perhaps these rules should only apply to Part 121 and 125 carriers.#apr.828.2
n,.. not all airlines allow the entire canceled value of the ticket to apply to a new ticket..#apr.829.0
n,UNited allows you to "bank" the value of the ticket..#apr.829.1
n,there is a time limit of one year..#apr.829.2
n,also, United charges a "change of ticket fee" of at least $150.#apr.829.3
u,I agree..#apr.830.0
u,the airlines should be required to post the entire cost of the ticket including fees and taxes.#apr.830.1
u,Banning peanuts is lunacy!#apr.833.0
u,Allergy sufferers know they have an issue.#apr.833.1
u,Lets get real!#apr.833.2
u,A simple warning peanuts may be present on a flight should suffice!#apr.833.3
u,Bumping should require double compensation to the bumped passenger.#apr.834.0
u,The inconvenience and effort needed to rebook in today's world are huge!#apr.834.1
u,One should be compensated accordingly.#apr.834.2
u,However, airlines should first be allowed to seek voluntary bumps and negotiate compensation with them.#apr.834.3
u,Only forced bumps should be compensated at higher rates.#apr.834.4
u,I'd like to add my voice to say that all flights should be covered, including international flights.#apr.836.0
u,I'd like to add my voice to say that all flights should be covered, including international flights.#apr.837.0
u,so, as for the specifics, the tarmac delay should be no more than 3 hours.#apr.837.1
u,If having it for all planes is not practical, then planes designed for 30 or more passengers should be covered.#apr.837.2
u,Airlines need to get over themselves, and make this part of the contract of carriage, and then operate in a customer-friendly fashion, which includes ample communications when ANY problem arises.#apr.837.3
u,Ample means updates at least every 5 minutes,#apr.837.4
u,and the updates should be as informative as possible.#apr.837.5
u,Airports should certainly have their own tarmac contingency plans, to help facilitate any changes that may need to occur if there is a long delay - getting passengers off the plane, bringing food, water, etc.#apr.837.6
u,And yes, airlines should be required to inform passengers that they can deplane if the delay is at the gate.#apr.837.7
u,This should be able to be handled with a minimum of fuss.#apr.837.8
u,Disclosure on the carrier's web site is the best way to get separate optional-fee information to the public.#apr.838.0
u,Code-shares are tricky,#apr.838.1
n,since usually the code-share computers don't talk to each other.#apr.838.2
u,For this situation, I think the differences should also be disclosed on tickets.#apr.838.3
u,ALL fees should be listed.#apr.838.4
u,Including a second full fare price doesn't seem as if it will add much, but rather may generate more confusion.#apr.838.5
u,A 3-month period for displaying information about changes on websites is about right,#apr.838.6
u,and this seems like the most efficient way to make the information available to the public.#apr.838.7
u,These requirements should apply to all carriers.#apr.838.8
u,Baggage fees should not be allowed to vary between code-share partners -#apr.838.9
u,I can't think of any others.#apr.838.10
u,Finally, I think airlines should consider having a fee for carry-on luggage, rather than checked luggage,#apr.838.11
u,which would avoid the increasing scrimmage for overhead space on full flights!#apr.838.12
u,In addition, I agree with whoever said that airlines should enforce the rules they already have in place about appropriate sizes for checked luggage.#apr.838.13
e,I am not a peanut allergy sufferer,#apr.839.0
e,but as a physician, I have both taken care of children with acute peanut allergies, and also responded to calls for physicians on flights.#apr.839.1
u,The equipment and conditions available on a flight are laughable for a true emergency,#apr.839.2
u,and I truly don't see what the problem is with banning peanuts and products with peanuts in them on flights.#apr.839.3
u,There is plenty of other food to eat,#apr.839.4
u,and this seems like the most sensible, civil solution.#apr.839.5
u,I don't want to be the one trying to maintain a kid's airway while the pilot lands the plane emergently,#apr.839.6
u,and I'm sure other travelers don't want to have their flight interrupted by such an occurrence.#apr.839.7
u,The unbundle cost is not fair to passengers.#apr.842.0
u,We need to return to level of 2007, before the oil price soared.#apr.842.1
u,Airline should allow passengers to bring up to two baggages at no charge.#apr.842.2
n,Make the air ticket bundled like what public transportation are doing right now like Metro, Bus, Cruise, Train, that they don't charge for baggage fee.#apr.842.3
u,Make it more standard.#apr.842.4
u,I think there is a problem in assuming that a "blanket policy" is going to be a good solution for every customer.#apr.847.0
u,By definition, a "blanket policy" is going to make someone unhappy,#apr.847.1
n,because it involves tradeoffs.#apr.847.2
u,If you have a blanket "no-peanut" policy, peanut eaters will be unhappy;#apr.847.3
u,if you have a blanket "pro-peanut" policy, obviously allergy sufferers will be unhappy.#apr.847.4
u,I think the solution is to let the different airlines have different policies which are easily accessible by customers,#apr.847.5
u,so that customers can make their own decisions about where to fly.#apr.847.6
u,This way, peanut lovers and people who are allergic to peanuts can both get their ways- by choosing to fly different airlines.#apr.847.7
u,For example, you say that Southwest and JetBlue are both very accommodating.#apr.847.8
u,If this is the case  then you should reward those companies by giving them your business.#apr.847.9
u,Those who dislike those policies can choose to fly elsewhere.#apr.847.10
n,Here is a link I'm not sure if anyone else has posted from the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network about which airlines do not serve peanuts in coach class:#apr.847.11
u,Because this information is available to you, you are free to make your decision on this basis.#apr.847.12
u,I think, if anything, the DOT regulation should make sure that allergy policies are disclosed.#apr.847.13
u,However, airlines should be free to pursue different policies to give consumers the choice to fly peanut-free if they so desire.#apr.847.14
u,If you're concerned about wiping down in-flight surfaces, I read on the Southwest website that people who are allergic to peanuts can take morning flights,#apr.848.0
n,because the planes are cleaned every night.#apr.848.1
n,you can bring EpiPens onboard an airplane.#apr.849.0
e,I don't have an EpiPen,#apr.849.1
e,but I have Type I diabetes,#apr.849.2
e,and I bring an insulin pen and syringes with me on every flight .#apr.849.3
n,Also, while many peanut allergies are very serious,#apr.849.4
n,it is still not "highly likely" that a person with a peanut allergy with have a reaction on an airplane where peanuts are served.#apr.849.5
e,I can't access the entire article,#apr.849.6
n,but the following abstract has information on the number of peanut allergic individuals who had reactions inflight:#apr.849.7
u,I think baggage fees especially should be included in the price of the ticket.#apr.851.0
u,And all other relevant fees.#apr.851.1
u,It is not particularly important to include snacks#apr.851.2
u,but anything else that is essential to the flight should be included.#apr.851.3
u,Also, as others have stated, there needs to be better control of what passengers are allowed to carry-on.#apr.851.4
u,I am to the point where if I don't have to fly I won't#apr.851.5
u,because it has become such a zoo with people trying to cram oversized, so-called carryon bags into other peoples' space.#apr.851.6
u,Also, when they are stopped at the gate with an oversized "carry-on" they should be charged a fee to check it if the rest of us have paid a baggage check fee.#apr.851.7
u,Significant fees should be defined as those charged for something that is an essential part of the flight, i.e. seating, baggage, fuel,#apr.851.8
n,and I guess some airlines are considering charging for the use of overhead space and bathrooms.#apr.851.9
n,Because an airport cabin is a confined space#apr.852.0
n,there is a very real possibility that a person with a peanut allergy could actually die from exposure.#apr.852.1
u,There is absolutely no need for other passengers to have peanuts with a total disregard for the safety  of a fellow passenger.#apr.852.2
u,A similar problem, that should also be addressed, along with the peanut allergy problem, is the case of allowing small domestic pets in the cabin of a aircraft.#apr.852.3
u,People with allergic sensitivity to dog and cat dander are in danger of dying from an acute asthma attack.#apr.852.4
n,These animals are being stored under the seat in front of the pet owner#apr.852.5
n,which may be directly under an asthmatic passenger.#apr.852.6
u,Additionally, many pet owners do not keep these animals in their carriers for the entire flight which increases the chance of exposure.#apr.852.7
n,Even when there are no animals on a particular flight, their presence on previous flights  means that their dander is still present and a hazard to asthma sufferers.#apr.852.8
n,Service animals are often allowed on the seats of many flights by the cabin crews#apr.852.9
n,which can be deadly to an asthmatic occupying that seat on a subsequent flight.#apr.852.10
n,I keep reading people talk about the effect on them or their family#apr.875.0
u,and I understand their concern,#apr.875.1
u,but I also see them shrugging off the impact that anyone else feels there is on them  .#apr.875.2
u,as if that doesn't matter because "their" situation is more important#apr.875.3
u,Bans are bad things, bottom line.#apr.875.4
u,And banning things to accommodate a very small minority IS an infringement on the rest of society and their concerns are just as valid to them as your concerns are to you.#apr.875.5
u,In addition to disclosure, there needs to be a requirement that whatever fees were in effect the day the ticket was purchased, are the fees the passenger actually pays.#apr.877.0
n,Since tickets can be purchased well in advance,#apr.877.1
n,it is quite possible for fees to change between the time the ticket is purchased and the actual date of travel.#apr.877.2
u,As for ticket agents, as a travel agent, I have no problem with requiring ticket agents to disclose fees as well, but only if there is an automated way for us to get that information from the airlines.#apr.877.3
u,I also should not have any liability for any changes in that policy by the airline between the time the ticket is purchased and the actual flight date.#apr.877.4
u,Keep in mind that you wouldn't be able to get out of the plane if it were in the air, either.#apr.886.0
u,I think deplaning is a bit extreme,#apr.886.1
u,because it could throw an already imbalanced flight schedule out of whack, and might delay flights even further or lead to cancellation.#apr.886.2
e,I sat on a tarmac in London for five hours earlier this year,#apr.886.3
u,but I'd rather wait it out than hop off the plane and miss an opportunity to take off.#apr.886.4
u,However, I see no problem with regular passenger updates on the progress of the delay.#apr.886.5
u,I'd just like to respond to this as one of those people who needs to plan around meals.#apr.887.0
e,I have juvenile diabetes ,#apr.887.1
u,so my food intake needs to be fairly regular to keep me healthy and coherent.#apr.887.2
u,Obviously, this is important to me.#apr.887.3
u,However, that doesn't mean that I expect the airline to feed me.#apr.887.4
e,I always bring snacks onto the plane  to hold me over, just in case.#apr.887.5
u,It's hard to predict when you're going to need to pack an entire meal,#apr.887.6
u,but it's very easy to stick a granola bar and an apple into your bag for the flight.#apr.887.7
u,There is nothing preventing people from feeding themselves on the plane, especially if they have a medical condition, as I do.#apr.887.8
u,The problem can't be solved this way.#apr.890.0
n,Airlines know ahead of time that flights are oversold,#apr.890.1
u,but they don't know whether all ticketed customers will show up on time or at all.#apr.890.2
e,For example, recently I got a free roundtrip flight with frequent flier miles,#apr.890.3
u,even though I only needed a one-way trip#apr.890.4
e,only a roundtrip was available for the frequent flier miles.#apr.890.5
e,Of course, I never showed up for the return flight,#apr.890.6
u,because I never intended to return.#apr.890.7
u,If this flight had been oversold, the airline would know ahead of time,#apr.890.8
u,but they would not have known that I only got a roundtrip flight because it was my only option.#apr.890.9
u,Airlines could send out a notice to customers that the flight had been oversold,#apr.890.10
u,but they can't know until the customers have checked in or begun boarding whether all the ticketed customers are present or not.#apr.890.11
u,Unfortunately, there's no way to give advance notice.#apr.890.12
u,It would be prudent for a study to be done on this issue to fully understand it.#apr.891.0
u,Right now parents, myself included, chose not to fly for fear of their child having a severe reaction in a highly inconvenient place.#apr.891.1
u,Personally, I can't tell you that my son would die on a plane,#apr.891.2
u,but I can't promise you that he wouldn't have an anaphylactic reaction that could be very life threatening.#apr.891.3
u,A study would answer the questions as to how often it is an issue, how many people have this issue, and how they chose to fly because of it.#apr.891.4
u,There are currently too many unknowns.#apr.891.5
n,In public and private schools, peanuts are frequently banned#apr.891.6
u,because it is viewed as a disability and would prevent these children from attending school.#apr.891.7
u,That fact alone seems to show that it makes sense to consider a ban in other arenas as well.#apr.891.8
u,I am concerned about the length of time customers are put "on hold" or spend trying to navigate automated call centers.#apr.900.0
n,I posit that this industry, among others, is costing the American public an enormous amount of time, money and productivity due to wasting the customer's time.#apr.900.1
u,I wonder if a mandatory maximum waiting time could be legislated beyond which there would be either a fine or a credit to the customer.#apr.900.2
u,I believe that a maximum waiting time could be established and that beyond that waiting time the customer should be offered a call back appointment from the airline without losing the customer's place in line.#apr.900.3
u,I support all proposed regulations.#apr.904.0
u,Price changed after purchase should not be allowed#apr.904.1
u,Air travel is often in conjunction with other other commitments such as tours or cruises with can not be canceled on short notice without penalty.#apr.904.2
u,Airlines should not be able to advertise a one-way fare unless it is indeed the price for one way, not based on round trip.#apr.909.0
u,They should not be able to ask for additional money if the price goes up unless the opposite is true...#apr.909.1
u,if prices go down, the consumer should get an immediate refund-not have to ask for it.#apr.909.2
u,Honest price information will definitely help the consumer make an informed decision about which airline to fly.#apr.909.3
u,I'm not concerned how the changes will affect ticket sellers ... it is false advertising they're engaged in.#apr.909.4
u,I did not see mention of compensation for non-weather related delays or cancellations.#apr.912.0
u,There should be a minimum level of compensation e.g. meal voucher for every 4 hours of delay... hotel vouchers or reimbursement if a flight is canceled.#apr.912.1
e,My last experience w or  UAL cancellation was some economy class passengers received meal and hotel vouchers, others did not#apr.912.2
e,they indicated they purchased non-refundable tickets just like a lot of other passengers.#apr.912.3
e,There was no consistency.#apr.912.4
e,In one instance, the customer service desk agent said he ran out of hotel vouchers...#apr.912.5
u,there should be an airline contingency plan that is communicated to all passengers involved.#apr.912.6
u,All the real charges are burdened on the consumer with only limited impositions on the carriers.#apr.913.0
u,I often travel in a party of 4#apr.913.1
e,and when the airlines change flights my seat assignments are all over.#apr.913.2
u,I have been on flights where water was dripping from overhead, seats were seat backs and arm rests were stuck in bad positions, where the seat was sunken and were the smell was foul.#apr.913.3
u,I wonder if anyone has measured the noise damage caused by sitting in those last couple of aisles by the engines.#apr.913.4
e,I am been on trips where I was forced to stand in lines, rebook on very alternate roots and incurred delays due to equipment failure .#apr.913.5
u,There should be minimum standards for operation  and direct payback to the customers when these airlines deviate from the norm.#apr.913.6
e,I have to pay them when I do it#apr.913.7
u,All Airlines should be required to list the time at terminal, time to board, time out of gate, time wheels up, time wheels down, time to gate, time to deplane, time out of terminal for ALL flights at all airports on all tickets sold from any source.#apr.915.0
u,Missing any one time by 10 minutes entitles each passenger one round trip ticket anywhere that airlines flys for one year without any restrictions.#apr.915.1
u,If they miss any one time by 30 minutes or any combination of times within 30 minutes, each passenger can fly anywhere that airlines flys for free for one full year.#apr.915.2
u,If they miss any time, or combination of times, by one hour, or more, then all passengers on that flight fly for free anywhere that airline flys for life.#apr.915.3
u,Also, Tarmac delays should be limited to one hour and then ONLY if the sircraft has hot food  and water on board to feed the passengers while they wait.#apr.915.4
u,The toilets must have capacity to cover all ticketed passengers for triple the duration of the flight just to cover ground delays and diversions.#apr.915.5
n,While the AC is on hold, the seat belt sign is off, toilets are available, and cabin service serves a full hot meal .#apr.915.6
n,If the AC is not equipped to provide such services then a maximum tarmac delay of 30 minutes is permitted.#apr.915.7
u,The 30 minutes is from door close to door open.#apr.915.8
u,Taxi time counts in the delay time.#apr.915.9
u,No AC should be permitted to taxi more than 30 minutes, of this 30 minutes only 10 minutes are permitted to be without moving.#apr.915.10
u,Moving is regulated at greater than 5 MPH and not moving is regulated at 5 MPH or less.#apr.915.11
u,Of couse the Airlines and Airports will say that they cannot live with these regulations.#apr.915.12
u,It is a simple scheduling issue.#apr.915.13
n,At the present time there is NO scheduling#apr.915.14
n,because no one pays if the passengers are just sitting on the runway without food, water, or toilets.#apr.915.15
u,Let us MAKE the airlines and airports actual schedule just as every other business does,#apr.915.16
u,it is just in time delivery, and the car company can do it for the thousands of parts in a car.#apr.915.17
u,This rule should apply to all airlines and airport that are FAA regulated and operate scheduled flights.#apr.915.18
u,Tarmac delays would become a thing of the past after this rule was pasted.#apr.915.19
u,This system would force the airlines to develop realistic schedules and then make the flight.#apr.915.20
u,As it is now the airline can get your money and then cancel the flight after sitting on the aircraft for 6 hours with no payout.#apr.915.21
u,MAKE THEM PAY!!!#apr.915.22
u,The issue that I have is two fold.#apr.916.0
u,First, take a look at the high and low price for a seat on an AC for a particular flight.#apr.916.1
n,There are well established ways to compute an "average" passenger including "average baggage".#apr.916.2
u,The airlines should also know the cost of flying and AC from point a to point B at full capacity.#apr.916.3
n,Now that we know the average passenger, the total capacity, and the total cost it is a simple math problem to determine price per passenger.#apr.916.4
u,If the low price noted above is below break even then the airline is losing money.#apr.916.5
u,if the high price is very much above break even then the airline is ripping off the customer .#apr.916.6
u,In any case the cost per passenger seat mile should be public knowledge and listed on the ticket along with the trip length in miles.#apr.916.7
u,Then the customer can see what is really going on.#apr.916.8
n,Jetblue can fly A to B for $89.#apr.916.9
u,Detail cost analysis would not, I beleive, support the first class ticket cost.#apr.916.10
u,The second issue is one of compensation.#apr.916.11
u,It is difficult for me to accept sitting on the ground for 3 hours without being allowed out of the seat, no food, toilets overflowing, etc#apr.916.12
n,while the CEO takes home millions of dollars.#apr.916.13
u,What does s or he do for this millions of dollars.#apr.916.14
u,S or he surely did not effectively manage the AC I was on nor did his subordinates manage that AC.#apr.916.15
u,So, why is s or he worth millions of dollars.#apr.916.16
u,Let us tie CEO compensation to performance,#apr.916.17
u,now that is a novel idea!!!#apr.916.18
u,A side issue is the concept of checked baggage vs carry on baggage.#apr.916.19
u,People are carrying on very big bags because of the checked baggage fees and the general hassle of checked baggage.#apr.916.20
u,BUT when you are the last third of the plane to board you have to leave your bag at the gate for placement in the baggage hold.#apr.916.21
n,Now, this is for CONTINENTAL#apr.916.22
n,but I assume that other Airlines operate in the same fashion.#apr.916.23
e,I was told by the gate agent that I had to check my bag.#apr.916.24
e,I asked what the Airline liability was.#apr.916.25
e,I was told, after I repeated the question several times with NO response form the agent, that if I said one more word I would NOT be allowed to Board.#apr.916.26
u,My issue was that I had a laptop, money, credit cards, medicines, etc in my bag#apr.916.27
e,AND I had no where to place them if I gave up the bag.#apr.916.28
e,So, after I return I wrote the CEO.#apr.916.29
u,Of course that esteemed gentlemen id SO busy managing that he could not take time from his extremely busy schedule to reply#apr.916.30
e,so I got a letter from Customer Service,#apr.916.31
e,note that this letter is not from the CEOs Office, an executive complaint manger, or anyone special, just Customer Service.#apr.916.32
e,They said , "   Exclusionary items remain exclusionary regardless of the method of being checked.  This includes cash,...  "#apr.916.33
e,The letter does on to state  "...Passengers not wishing to gate check their carry on bag may opt to be rebooked for a later available flight that MAY have available carry on space... Customers may request the presence of a supervisor at any time.  However, the customer must be aware that our supervisors have assigned duties ...It may be a wait for a Supervisor to arrive.  During this time the flight may board and depart... we sincerely regret that the situation has left you with a negative impression ...We hop to leave you with a better impression..."#apr.916.34
u,In other words, we  got your money and we  can have our agents abuse you and mistreat you,#apr.916.35
u,and you  have no recourse whatsoever.#apr.916.36
u,This is why I try not to fly.#apr.916.37
u,I believe that CONTINENTAL is a terrible airline devoid of leadership#apr.916.38
u,but they are not alone.#apr.916.39
u,I believe that the government should step in a STRONGLY regulate them until the CEOs learn to manage#apr.916.40
u,and the rank and file learn that they can be replaced.#apr.916.41
u,The 3 hour "rule" is too long for passenger comfort and support.#apr.917.0
u,For the obvious reasons this time frame should be halved.#apr.917.1
u,I don't have a problem with baggage fees, except there should be a reasonable "baggage exception"  before fees are imposed#apr.918.0
u,If a flight contains a passenger or passengers, who present or forewarn the airline of this condition by providing a doctors certificate as to existence of severe allergic reaction to the presence of such foods then that passenger must be accommodated.#apr.920.0
u,For those of us who suffer from claustrophobia-and yet have exercised the courage to fly-- every minute of delay behind a closed airplane door is an agony.#apr.925.0
u,To those unsympathetic, please imagine listening to the screws of your coffin being inexorably tightened with you alive, inside.#apr.925.1
u,It is unlikely that  Pepto Bismal, a NY Times bestseller or thoughts of Aunt Em are going to be of much use.#apr.925.2
u,Provide a secured room for deplaning if it is known that the delay will be more than a half hour, at all airports, national and international.#apr.925.3
u,And de-plane.#apr.925.4
u,Keep us informed of what is going on.#apr.925.5
u,Keep the air flowing.#apr.925.6
e,I'm retired and on on a fixed income.#apr.927.0
u,I have to carefully budget for all trips, including family emergencies.#apr.927.1
u,I need to know up front before I leave home, how much everything costs.#apr.927.2
u,I want the option to pay for a full fare that includes everything or a reduced fare where I can make suitable arrangements before I board a flight.#apr.927.3
u,Once again, as a retiree on a fixed income I want to know the entire price up front and not have it suddenly changed or modified in any way.#apr.928.0
u,I have been horrified by stories of people stuck on planes for three, four, six, eight hours.#apr.929.0
u,The very idea that you are on a plane, looking at the terminal out the window, and trapped there is absurd.#apr.929.1
u,These are flying buses, not spacecraft!#apr.929.2
u,I can understand moderate delays due to unpredictable circumstances,#apr.929.3
u,and I appreciate the potential for havoc with schedules if people are getting on and off.#apr.929.4
n,Everyone on the plane has passed screening,#apr.929.5
n,and everyone out on the ground has passed screening.#apr.929.6
u,I absolutely support any policies which will lessen the possibility of being trapped longer than two hours!#apr.929.7
u,And I'm not claustrophobic.#apr.929.8
u,Not saying the Europeans or the Japanese or the Canadians have a magic solution,#apr.941.0
u,If you purchase a ticket and the airline cannot confirm a specific seat  because the flight is oversold, they should not charge your credit card because you are actually flying standby.#apr.944.0
u,And they should have to tell you that you are flying standby.#apr.944.1
e,We were caught on a return flight without confirmed seats,#apr.944.2
e,and the "best" the airline could do was put my husband on one flight and make me wait for a later  flight--#apr.944.3
e,even though we had a single car at the home airport and a very long drive home.#apr.944.4
e,Thankfully, a fellow passenger offered her seat and took a voucher.#apr.944.5
u,In no other type of purchase do you make a reservation and pay full price in advance  without any guarantee that you will get what you have already paid for.#apr.944.6
u,I second keiserrgx's comments.#apr.950.0
e,The delays I have experienced have been due to work actions.#apr.950.1
u,It would be nice if the regulation could apply to U.S. airlines departing from foreign airports as well as domestic flights.#apr.950.2
u,All fees should be disclosed "as part of the selection process" before the transaction is finalized.#apr.956.0
u,This should include code share fees.#apr.956.1
u,Personally, I prefer full fare for everyone -- or at least always include seat assignments and food.#apr.956.2
u,Eliminate combat among passengers pushing ahead in the queue to get preferred seating ;-#apr.956.3
u,And who wants to sit next to someone eating a sloppy joe out of a bag.#apr.956.4
u,If carriers reserve one overhead bin per seat  that should alleviate the issue of no bins left for those forced to board last.#apr.956.5
u,Oh, and enforce the size limit --#apr.956.6
u,though this might involve having security staff on hand to enforce.#apr.956.7
u,The size boxes at the gate should be realistic, i.e. reflect the actual bin size and shape.#apr.956.8
u,I would agree with the 3 points in this post cited as the main flight status communication issues:#apr.961.0
n,* There is a major disconnect in information between gate agents and reservation agents;#apr.961.1
n,* There is no prompt communication between the airline and the passenger;#apr.961.2
n,* and There is no way to guarantee re-booking or re-routing, without penalty, without going to the airport and waiting in long lines.#apr.961.3
e,I had a long delay in May at O'Hare, spent several hours waiting in 5 different lines -#apr.961.4
e,2 of those lines were to use the automated kiosks at the "Customer Service Center" that had exactly zero personnel of the airline there to help#apr.961.5
e,and 4 of the 7 kiosks were not working.#apr.961.6
e,When the kiosk said it couldn't change my flight, I used the attached phone to call the airline, and was told they could do for me what the kiosk was "not smart enough to be able to do"#apr.961.7
e,but they would have to charge me for doing it on the phone,#apr.961.8
e,or I could go to the gate and have it done for no charge.#apr.961.9
e,Problem was, my gate and most other gates had no airline agents at them.#apr.961.10
e,I have had this experience a number of times before over the last several years.#apr.961.11
u,The communication was terrible and the only was to change my fully refundable, fully changeable ticket was to pay the airline.#apr.961.12
n,Some airline websites  provide the % of time the flight is on-time, such as in the "flight details" pop-up in the list of flights when you are shopping.#apr.962.0
n,If not, this information is available to the public on flightstats.com.#apr.962.1
u,Several of the reasons cited for delays are air traffic control and late arriving aircraft.#apr.963.0
n,Air traffic in a couple key spots in this country is congested,#apr.963.1
n,in part, because airlines are flying more smaller planes rather than fewer larger planes - to carry the same amount of passengers.#apr.963.2
n,This takes up more landing slots.#apr.963.3
n,1 Planes are charged landing fees based on weight,#apr.963.4
n,and therefore it can be cheaper to land 2 smaller, lighter planes rather than one larger, heavier plane.#apr.963.5
n,2 Airlines are worried that if they swap out 2 lighter planes for 1 heavier plane, then another airline will come in and take the landing slot and offer an extra flight of its own and siphon off passengers.#apr.963.6
n,Airlines worry that if they don't offer the most frequent flights, packed especially into the most desired times for business travelers, their competition will.#apr.963.7
u,This leads to an inefficient bunching of many flights on somewhat smaller planes at peak times, leading to congestion and delays.#apr.963.8
u,The government should change the basis on which landing fees are calculated as a start toward dis-incentivizing these practices.#apr.963.9
u,1 The landing fees should not be based primarily on weight, but rather should be based on the fact that the plane is using a landing slot, with only some consideration given to the weight of the aircraft.#apr.963.10
u,That would encourage airlines to choose larger planes that can carry more people with less per-person environmental impact and fewer overall landing slots, reducing delays.#apr.963.11
u,2 The landing fees should be somewhat greater at peak times of day to encourage airlines to spread out their flights more, thereby reducing congestion and delays.#apr.963.12
e,I travel with my dog about twice a year.#apr.974.0
n,Because he is 28 pnds, he has to be checked and travel in cargo.#apr.974.1
n,It costs anywhere from $300-400 round trip to take him.#apr.974.2
u,I would rather be allowed to put him in a carrier that is secured by the seat belt and have him travel in the seat next to me , especially if I have to pay the same or more for his ticket in cargo as I do for mine.#apr.974.3
u,The cost and stress of handing him over to cargo is wearing me down#apr.974.4
u,and I will most likely not take him on some future trips#apr.974.5
u,so they will loose my business.#apr.974.6
u,If the airlines could make their processes more customer and dog friendly, it would make travel much more enjoyable.#apr.974.7
u,I'm sure my dog would behave as well or better than some humans in the cabin.#apr.974.8
u,Disclosure about all additional fees that used to be part of the ticket price, food, beverage, blankets, etc. should all be included BEFORE the consumer purchases the airline ticket online.#apr.982.0
u,I would also hold ticket agents operating separately from  the airline to include these fees.#apr.982.1
u,They should be broken down again in the spirit of full disclosure for consumers trying to make informed decisions about purchasing flight tickets.#apr.982.2
u,All carriers domestic and foreign should be required to comply with full disclosure of all fees extracted from a consumer in the course of the flight to a destination and back again.#apr.982.3
u,Regards code-share partners they should align their fees with their partners' fees to make it more convenient for the consumer.#apr.982.4
u,It is the consumer that is the client that allows airlines and the travel industry to exist and prosper in the first place.#apr.982.5
u,30-minute delay seems reasonable.#apr.983.0
e,I just experienced that our of Charlotte, Va. two days ago.#apr.983.1
e,U.S. Airways was quite prompt in notifying us of the closure of Washington-National airport due to thunderstorms.#apr.983.2
e,In all I was delayed 60 minutes but informed at the gate over the loudspeaker approximately every 15-30 minutes.#apr.983.3
u,Standardizing methods for updates is a good idea.#apr.983.4
u,Hard as this may be to believe#apr.983.5
n,not every one carries a cell phone or other pda.#apr.983.6
u,So airlines should, at the very minimum, continually update on their flight information screens throughout the airport and at the gate along with loud speaker updates at the gate area.#apr.983.7
u,Yes, ALL flights should be covered by this notification requirements, small or big, domestic or foreign.#apr.983.8
u,It would allow consumers to notify waiting parties at the other end of the flight, hotels, car rental companies, etc.#apr.983.9
u,The 3 hour rule should be UNIVERSAL, i.e., international and domestic. No exceptions.#apr.990.0
u,US carriers tarmac contingency plans ought to be included in the airline's contract of carriage.#apr.990.1
u,The reason for the delay, the current status of the flight, etc. shall be communicated on a real time basis to passengers.#apr.990.2
n,It is my understanding that airlines pay a federal excise tax on fares;#apr.992.0
n,they do not pay on "fees",#apr.992.1
u,so they want to separate them to save money.#apr.992.2
u,The consumer needs to know the FULL fare upfront.#apr.993.0
u,This includes all taxes and fees plus any ancillary fees such as checked luggage, food, seat reservations, food and blankets and pillows.#apr.993.1
u,I also feel that carriers should not be allowed to increase a fare once you have paid for it.#apr.993.2
e,I have had this happen and it was $150, not a paltry sum.#apr.993.3
u,Consumers cannot make choices without knowing the full cost of a decision.#apr.993.4
u,It is deceptive marketing to not declare all fees.#apr.993.5
u,Airlines, and 3rd party sites should be required to display the full price.#apr.1005.0
u,Any optional fees should be disclosed and the prospective purchaser given the option of selecting those wanted,#apr.1005.1
u,so they are included in the price and can be paid at the same time as the ticket.#apr.1005.2
u,This allows people to compare the total fares.#apr.1005.3
u,Ticket sellers should not be allowed to raise the price after the ticket is purchases, except possibly if they will also reduce the price if lower fares are later published for the flight.#apr.1005.4
u,I normally fly Southwest,#apr.1006.0
n,which does not have baggage fees.#apr.1006.1
u,However, I do think lines that charge should have to include it in the fee shown possibly having to ask how many bags will be checked.#apr.1006.2
u,Also, purchases should always be able to pay the fees with the ticket instead of waiting until they are at the airport.#apr.1006.3
u,I have no real problem if some airlines want to charge for baggage,#apr.1006.4
u,although I would prefer a charge only  for more than one bag#apr.1006.5
u,most people will need one.#apr.1006.6
u,I would prefer there be charges  for people who try to bring full-size bags into the cabin.#apr.1006.7
u,I have come close to having bags dropped on me several times by people attempting to lift bags that were too heavy for them.#apr.1006.8
n,Note that while liquids cannot be brought through security,#apr.1007.0
e,I have found that empty water bottles are OK and then can be filled at a drinking fountain or rest room.#apr.1007.1
u,Also, some airports do not gouge people for food and liquids.#apr.1007.2
u,While I have some concerns about what else people might want banned,#apr.1008.0
u,I have no problem with a peanut ban.#apr.1008.1
u,I think it would be easier on the airlines to either never have peanuts, or use something else when someone with an allergy is flying.#apr.1008.2
u,A bubble around the person puts too much responsibility on the flight crew that has other things to worry about.#apr.1008.3
u,Since people could be switched to a flight at the last minute, and changing snacks already loaded could be a problem, I suspect this would just ban peanuts completely.#apr.1008.4
u,While I agree that people with allergies should be ready to deal with problems,#apr.1008.5
u,I do not consider telling people with severe problems to just not fly to be reasonable.#apr.1008.6
u,Taking a boat to other continents is not a reasonable option, nor is keeping people from visiting them.#apr.1008.7
u,Since travel--especially long trips--basically require luggage to be transported I truly believe it is misleading to not allow at least one piece of luggage as part of the trip.#apr.1010.0
u,If all carriers were required to allow one bag included in the price then prices could be easily compared.#apr.1010.1
u,Anything else is really false advertising.#apr.1010.2
u,And this would hopefully minimize the incentive to overuse carry-on luggage to avoid a fee.#apr.1010.3
u,Any delay beyond 3 hours is not acceptable.#apr.1012.0
u,The plane should be brought back and passengers deplaned.#apr.1012.1
u,The pilot should be aware of the average and maximum tarmac delay for the flight and take the decision.#apr.1012.2
u,The passengers has to right to know the delay.#apr.1012.3
u,My problem is that the passengers are not kept informed.#apr.1012.4
u,When a prolonged delay happen, since the seat belt sign is on the lavatories are closed by  the staff#apr.1012.5
u,and passengers not give the basic amenities.#apr.1012.6
u,This should be avoided on delays that are more than 90 minutes.#apr.1012.7
u,Airlines should not charge for luggage unless you have more than 3.#apr.1023.0
u,Food service should be available for trips more than 2 hours.#apr.1024.0
n,They now charge for pop, coffee and bottle of Alcohol.#apr.1024.1
n,You can't bring your own,#apr.1024.2
n,as the gate will confiscate it.#apr.1024.3
u,Your new requirements are excellent and warranted.#apr.1032.0
u,I would add to all of the ideas below that when flights are significantly delayed or canceled, the passenger's ticket should be tranferable to another carrier who has a flight with open seats leaving for the same destination shortly -- and that the agent should expedite that change for the customer.#apr.1032.1
u,Yes, absolutely passengers should be allowed to deplane whenever possible.#apr.1034.0
u,Clearly they should not even be boarded until there is a reasonable degree of certainty that no long delays are in the offing.#apr.1034.1
u,Better planning, time management, and scheduling could certainly help in this regard.#apr.1034.2
u,Holding passengers in cramped seats with poor air circulation and minimal services, little information and consideration for their comfort is both physically and mentally unhealthy.#apr.1034.3
u,Every conceivable effort and regulation should be made to avoid tarmac delays for all flights.#apr.1034.4
u,More than a thirty-minute notice seems essential now that passenger are required to be at the airport an hour to two in advance of their flight.#apr.1035.0
u,However, requiring advance notice by all and every means is an excellent idea and a new regulation I support.#apr.1035.1
u,I support DOT's proposed regulations.#apr.1036.0
u,The pricing system now in place seems like an Old West, frontier-days free-for-all: get as much as you can any way that you can.#apr.1036.1
u,I never know when to buy a ticket, early or late.#apr.1036.2
u,Also, to add to the comments below, I agree wholeheartedly with the complaints about too little leg room.#apr.1036.3
u,It's become a torture to fly long distances, something to be endured rather than enjoyed, at least for those of us in coach.#apr.1036.4
u,A sad demise for the industry and its clients.#apr.1036.5
u,This should go without question that airlines should not be allowed to use their great judgement and keep people on airplanes.#apr.1037.0
e,I have been on planes in excess of 3 hours and then fly the normal route.#apr.1037.1
u,Why should airlines be given the authority to make these choices when they have proven over time they cannot.#apr.1037.2
u,This is ridiculous.#apr.1038.0
u,Airlines should not be allowed to oversell flights.#apr.1038.1
e,I have seen over my many years of travel, the everyday person who travels maybe once or twice and has no status with the airlines....get bumped.#apr.1038.2
u,They have no power and the airlines could give a damm.#apr.1038.3
e,I once saw an airline say to a mother that you could fly but your child needs to get the next flight.#apr.1038.4
u,I am not sure how possible this is to implement.#apr.1039.0
u,I agree the airlines should notify,#apr.1039.1
u,but I generally have not had a bad experience due to checking status online and using tools freely available for cell phones.#apr.1039.2
u,This is impossible to regulate.#apr.1040.0
u,Government should stay clear of this as it would equate to a search of bags to look for contraband.#apr.1040.1
u,People need to understand there is risk in everything and the government can't regulate everything.#apr.1040.2
u,Government needs to step up to insure proper protection of consumers from poor judgement by the airlines.#apr.1043.0
u,When in the US airspace...all planes need to abide to the rules of the land.#apr.1044.0
u,When you visit a country you are expected to follow the rules governing the land...#apr.1044.1
u,this should not be any different.#apr.1044.2
u,Technology should be able to be implemented to make data available.#apr.1045.0
n,Fighter jets already have the capacity to plug into a laptop to get readings of systems.#apr.1045.1
n,Formula one does this as well.#apr.1045.2
u,I see this implemented via a standard technology that uploads to computers where reports could be generated.#apr.1045.3
u,For airlines that do not upload data and or fails audits, they are fined and could loose routes.#apr.1045.4
u,This will bite the consumer in increased fees and put further strain on carriers....not to mention airports struggling with less planes.#apr.1046.0
u,To me, the fees will need to be incorporated with a pricing scheme that will include a bare minimum airfare carriers need to charge.#apr.1046.1
u,Going after volume is a risk to people and the industry.#apr.1046.2
u,I think safety records should be available.#apr.1053.0
u,Also the lateness of particular flights or routes.#apr.1053.1
u,There should be a penalty for late luggage that is based partly on the charge an airline makes for luggage#apr.1053.2
u,so if I pay $50 for that bag, it should be much higher than if I pay nothing for that bag.#apr.1053.3
u,I also think there should be rules against charging different prices for aisle, window, and middle seats.#apr.1053.4
u,This is particularly an issue for people flying in groups;#apr.1053.5
u,Since the cost of flights differs so much, this does not seem fair.#apr.1053.6
u,Of Course peanuts SHOULD BE banned on airplanes!#apr.1062.0
u,People who post things like the perfume comment do not understand while smelly perfume can be annoying,  food allergies can be deadly#apr.1062.1
u,and it can happen quickly.#apr.1062.2
n,Pretzels are a safe alternative#apr.1062.3
u,and any passenger that is missing peanuts so much on their flight can eat all the peanut butter and peanuts they want when they get home.#apr.1062.4
u,All flights should have the 3 hour limit, including international.#apr.1063.0
u,And airports should have plans -#apr.1063.1
u,it doesn't seem like it would be hard to create a separate area in the terminal so that no re-screening is necessary.#apr.1063.2
u,Deplaning in a delay situation can be done back to front in an orderly fashion just like boarding.#apr.1063.3
u,There is no question that clean, working bathrooms, water and AC should be required.#apr.1063.4
u,I think the new caps are high enough and don't need to be eliminated at this time.#apr.1064.0
u,On smaller flights it is reasonable to prohibit overbooking.#apr.1064.1
u,I like the idea of the airline giving miles for zero fare tickets,#apr.1064.2
u,but if you make this onerous the airlines will probably reduce their frequent flier rewards.#apr.1064.3
u,It should not be hard for a ticket agent to disclose all the risks and information about a potential bumping.#apr.1064.4
u,I thought the question wasn't about foreign carriers, but about international flights on all carriers.#apr.1086.0
n,We must understand that other governments may not view these rules as being benign and could very well impose restrictions on US carriers.#apr.1086.1
u,Beware the law of unforeseen consequences.#apr.1086.2
u,The tarmac delay problem is not caused by airlines, and in particular foreign airlines.#apr.1086.3
u,To submit them to significant operational or financial consequences because of something outside of their control doesn't seem appropriate.#apr.1086.4
u,Lets not forget the tarmac delay problem is the fault of the FAA and airports, allowing over scheduling and not restricting slots.#apr.1086.5
n,Eurocontrol  directs European airports to implement flow-control restrictions whenever an airport  cannot provide it's expected capacity.#apr.1086.6
u,When this happens airlines have to reduce their flights in proportion to the total number of slots they 'own' at that airport.#apr.1086.7
n,In the US when 'stuff' happens it becomes the airlines problem#apr.1086.8
n,competition law prohibits them from discussing solutions with their competitors.#apr.1086.9
u,Let's fix the problem, not the symptoms.#apr.1086.10
u,I fail to see why it is a "right" to fly so you can go somewhere "interesting".#apr.1089.0
u,You are partly right.#apr.1090.0
u,I would be upset if we had to make an emergency landing because someone did not take the proper precautions when they have a serious allergy and thus caused a hundred plus other people to have a major delay.#apr.1090.1
u,I always like it when someone talks about everyone else's "need" not being important when their own "need" is involved.#apr.1091.0
u,While you can argue someone doesn't have a "right" to wear perfume#apr.1091.1
u,I would counter that you have no more "right" to fly.#apr.1091.2
u,Sure, but it is not a right plain and simple.#apr.1091.3
u,So, stop trying to determine what everyone else "needs" they should be allowed to fulfill#apr.1091.4
u,and do your own due diligence to protect yourself with filter masks, alternate travel, or whatever.#apr.1091.5
u,If you ban everything that makes people "want to be sick" then you would have to ban air travel#apr.1094.0
u,since a far higher percentage of people in this country get air sick than have severe  reactions to peanuts#apr.1094.1
u,and believe me,#apr.1094.2
u,when you are air sick you really wish it was fatal at times.#apr.1094.3
u,The DOT is correct to consider allergies like this a disability.#apr.1102.0
u,Having several food allergies, including peanuts and tree nuts I am dismayed by the number of airlines that give out peanuts as snacks.#apr.1102.1
e,Thankfully, my peanut allergy is not life threatening-yet.#apr.1102.2
n,The more you are exposed to an allergen the worse the allergy can become.#apr.1102.3
u,I also have the issue, being a woman, that my allergies are becoming worse as I get closer to menopause.#apr.1102.4
u,Should my employment prospects be limited to those that never need me to travel .#apr.1102.5
u,Please ban peanuts from air travel.#apr.1102.6
n,I know Delta serves peanuts as I travel to and from Detroit on Delta.#apr.1103.0
u,I was really surprised to learn this as I didn't know until I was on the plane and in the air.#apr.1103.1
u,Oh and the two row minimum around a person with a peanut allergy is a joke.#apr.1103.2
u,Someone with a peanut allergy is not going to be protected by that!#apr.1103.3
u,It should be part of the rule.#apr.1105.0
e,As many times as I have flown, I can't remember a single time someone brought their own bag of peanuts on board.#apr.1105.1
u,But this way, if they are banned, you prevent some allergic person from potentially dying because someone is a selfish jerk.#apr.1105.2
u,pixel97-Hopefully, you'll never find out personally.#apr.1106.0
n,A server allergy to anything can result in death.#apr.1106.1

u,And its hell for the person suffering as well as those around them who are helpless to do anything.#apr.1106.3
u,Banning nuts is not a hard thing to do.#apr.1106.4

u,There is no need to reinvent the wheel.#apr.1112.0
u,Eurocontrol perform similar functions as the FAA#apr.1112.1
u,but Europe is complicated with overlapping ATC responsibilities.#apr.1112.2
u,What should be done is a review of how slots are determined and how they are allocated.#apr.1112.3
u,Additionally clear and transparent rules need to be in effect and applied when 'stuff' happens.#apr.1112.4
n,For example we often know 24-48 hours before a major snow events happens.#apr.1112.5
u,A committee made of the incumbent airlines, the airport and the FAA should be empowered  to discuss the situation and to make decisions.#apr.1112.6
u,For example if it is determined that the airport can only handle 75% of the schedule then the airlines can get on with it, rebooking  or  rerouting their customers long before they get the airport.#apr.1112.7
u,The way it works today the each airline does their own thing, waiving rebooking fees etc.#apr.1112.8
u,But this is done with a shotgun approach.#apr.1112.9
u,Passengers booked on flights that will operate will change,#apr.1112.10
u,when they don't have to -#apr.1112.11
u,and others will 'hope-for-the-best' and show up anyway.#apr.1112.12
u,Let's be honest here.#apr.1112.13
u,Free market principles don't work when two of three industry components are monopolies and really have little incentive to fix the problem.#apr.1112.14
u,airlines should give full disclosure on the amount they will pay rather than offering different prices to different people.#apr.1115.0
u,Also, inform travelers cash is an option.#apr.1115.1
u,If airlines have been bumping people off of small planes, they are not figuring accurately and should have a strict limit for overbooking or not be able to book overbook on small planes.#apr.1116.0
u,Agree that there should be an automatic inflation adjuster that would adjust caps regularly#apr.1117.0
u,Please, how us the total price and stop confusing people with deceptive advertising.#apr.1119.0
u,I agree with your proposed solutions.#apr.1119.1
u,i think that international should be charged the baggage fees that domestic travelers are charged with#apr.1124.0
u,because it is not fair to domestic travelers that have to pay the fees and international does not for the 1st 2 bags#apr.1124.1
n,and international is charged for the 3rd bag on#apr.1124.2
n,and domestic travelers are charged for the 1st 2 bags along with other fees as well "the hidden fees".#apr.1124.3
u,i agree with you kiminno the baggage fees are way out of control#apr.1126.0
n,for international alone it is free for the 1st 2 bags checked in and then after that they start charging#apr.1126.1
u,and i also agree that they need to meet our needs and not make us pay through our teeth and cost us a lot more money then our ticket cost us#apr.1126.2
u,This has always been a policy that outraged me, both as a business and personal traveler.#apr.1132.0
u,If the DOT can't get this under control we need to find another federal agency that can.#apr.1132.1
u,DOT needs to do a lot more than just give information about how the airlines can rip off the traveling public.#apr.1134.0
u,They need to regulate fees to a reasonable level.#apr.1134.1
u,The public relations black-eye airlines are getting for their "fee-frenzy" is their own fault,#apr.1134.2
u,but the DOT isn't doing much to assist them in overcoming it!#apr.1134.3
u,I can't imagine staying sane after being kept on the tarmac for three hours, let alone more!#apr.1135.0

u,I can remember when it was possible to put a coat on top of your luggage in the overhead bin and not have it emerge accordion pleated.#apr.1136.0
u,Charging for checked luggage has made the situation even worse.#apr.1136.1
u,I would like to see the rules about carry-on's, as to size and number, enforced.#apr.1136.2
u,As a person that has been diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy, I believe there should be a ban on ALL foods.#apr.1155.0
u,A lot of people do not understand how severe peanut allergies can be and how long the medicine lasts.#apr.1155.1
n,The medicine lasts around 10-15 min.#apr.1155.2
e,I usually carry 2 on my person when flying.#apr.1155.3
e,During one flight in 1999, we had to make an emergency landing#apr.1155.4
e,and I had to spend the night at the ER#apr.1155.5
e,because of peanut dust circulating through the cabin.#apr.1155.6
u,I've read what other people have said about other allergies,#apr.1155.7
u,and I say to ban all food items from being on planes .#apr.1155.8
u,You can live without peanuts or pretzels for food for 1-5 hours.#apr.1155.9
u,Other people may die because some people can't consider that because they are being selfish.#apr.1155.10
u,That takes care of that slippery slope.#apr.1155.11
u,Bumping should only be allowed for reimbursable tickets and when passengers are given time for cancellations without penalties.#apr.1172.0
u,Airline fares should be similar to way cruise lines price their cabins, with different fares for different seats and services.#apr.1173.0
u,There should be no hidden fees to be added later.#apr.1173.1
u,Thus, aisle seats could have one set of fares which themselves could differe according to what else is included, such as a second bag, food, right to use the bathroom more than once, an extra pillow, and so on.#apr.1173.2
u,However, all fares should include one free carryon and one free checked bag.#apr.1173.3
u,I suggested airlines use a system similar to cruise lines, differentiating fares by categories that specify seat location and services included.#apr.1176.0
u,Example- in the aisle seat category, differentiate front from back, and then including or not such services as an extra pillow, use of bathroom more than once, free earphone, etc.#apr.1176.1
u,But one carryon and one checked baggage should always be free, as also the right to use the bathroom one time and one bottle of water free.#apr.1176.2
u,Customer service should be with live people, not electronic operators.#apr.1177.0
u,Passenger rights should be clearly spelled out in the same way that cruise lines spell out their Terms and Conditions and their Insurance Plans.#apr.1177.1
u,Also think airlines should have insurance plans for cancellations.#apr.1177.2
u,Finally, why not adopt a reservation system similar to cruise lines, whereby a reservations requires a deposit with a final date for final payment.#apr.1177.3
u,The deposit can be fully or partially reimbursable or totally non reimbursable depending on clearly stated conditions--such as vacation periods, destination, category of fare, etc.#apr.1177.4
u,At least one bag and one carry on should always be free, under clearly specified size and weight limitations.#apr.1178.0
u,Lost baggage should also be regulated,#apr.1178.1
u,although I do not object to system in effect years ago.#apr.1178.2
u,Airlines should not be allowed to lie about delays and cancellations of flights.#apr.1179.0
u,Food allergies and other problems related to foods should be the sole responsibility of the passengers and in the case of children, their parents.#apr.1181.0
u,Airlines should continue to provide peanuts and other foods, whether free or at a cost.#apr.1181.1
u,People who may not know of their allergies should not be allowed to sue airlines  for their ignorance or lack of information about themselves.#apr.1181.2
u,Every adult person is responsible for his or her own health problems, if any, and for those of an accompanying child.#apr.1181.3
u,Foreign airlines flying to this country should submit to our regulations in the same manner that our airlines must submit to the regulations of the countries they fly to.#apr.1182.0
u,Long time members of frequent flier programs should not be treated the same as newer members or non members.  Information on passengers to be shared with others should be clearly specified#apr.1183.0
u,and passengers should be so advised.#apr.1183.1
u,Transparency should be the rule of the day in all matters of safety and security.#apr.1183.2
u,While I do believe that the first checked bag should be free ,#apr.1184.0
u,I think the bigger issue is that novice travelers are unfamiliar with the fees, how much they are and when they need to be paid for.#apr.1184.1
u,Airlines need to make it clear when quoting prices what the fees are for things that were previously included in flying - luggage, food and snacks, etc.#apr.1184.2
u,Services that were not included previously shouldn't have to be posted.#apr.1184.3
u,I say that because if you give a notice about too many fees then people get lost in the laundry list of fees and we're back to square one.#apr.1184.4
u,Baggage fees have created an issue with carry on bags.#apr.1184.5
n,Flights are fuller, and now there are more carry-on bags too.#apr.1184.6
u,Airlines need to enforce their policies of carry-on size.#apr.1184.7
u,I have no problem with charging a higher fee to gate check an over sized carry-on,#apr.1184.8
u,as it will force people to comply with carry-on rules and make the boarding process smoother and less dangerous.#apr.1184.9
u,If overhead space runs out and a bag needs to be gate checked, then a fee would not be appropriate.#apr.1184.10
u,I'm not a huge fan of the 3-hour tarmac delay policy.#apr.1188.0
u,But it's here.#apr.1188.1
u,I do think that airports should work with airlines to create contingency plans.#apr.1188.2
u,These plans should consider the use of deserted areas of airports  where a gate and it's area could possibly be used for passengers that include a bathroom without getting "lost" in the airport.#apr.1188.3
u,Anytime you let people off a plane you run the risk of passengers not coming back creating new concerns.#apr.1188.4
u,A dedicated area for this would limit these concerns.#apr.1188.5
u,If a plane has returned to a gate for the 3-hour rule then you should allow passengers off the plane,#apr.1188.6
u,otherwise the rule is a complete waste of time for everyone.#apr.1188.7
u,However, if the plane is going to have an open cabin door for less then 30 minutes#apr.1188.8
u,then I think it would just create more problems to make announcements allow passengers off.#apr.1188.9
u,If the door will only be open for 15 minutes and half your passengers get off someone probably isn't going to get back in time.#apr.1188.10
u,I do not know the likely hood of a sever reaction.#apr.1189.0
u,I would suspect that a peanut allergy suffer would know what type of reaction they are likely to have though.#apr.1189.1
u,If there was a rash of severe reactions, I don't think it would go unnoticed.#apr.1189.2
u,I do not believe a complete ban is appropriate or enforceable.#apr.1189.3
u,I think peanut allergy sufferers should communicate with their airlines about their allergies and make the appropriate restrictions for the flight, whether it's just a request not to take out peanut products or creating a peanut free zone.#apr.1189.4
u,Tarmac delays are airline and employee incompetence.#apr.1191.0
u,True weather delays are understandable#apr.1191.1
u,but the rest point to ineptitude and a lack of service oriented culture.#apr.1191.2
u,Airlines should be forced to refund passage for major delays and cancellations which include maintenance issues, late crews, baggage and gate employee incompetence.#apr.1191.3
u,The real problem here is not the airline#apr.1192.0
u,it is long TSA lines and requirements to be at the gate one to two hours ahead of time.#apr.1192.1
u,Check in lines are ridiculous#apr.1192.2
u,and making you do everything at the gate creates gridlock.#apr.1192.3
u,Airlines should be required to list the number of seats available at each price.#apr.1193.0
u,Also they should not be allowed to overbook.#apr.1193.1
u,proposed changes are good.#apr.1194.0
u,Foreign carriers should abide by the same rules as US carriers.#apr.1196.0
u,Full prices should be quoted#apr.1198.0
u,The airlines should be able to charge for anything on board except water.#apr.1198.1
u,Set a limit on the total size  of bags that can be carried on, thus ensuring everyone the chance to stash a bag, not just those in seating sections 1-3.#apr.1198.2
u,And do this before one gets to the gate.#apr.1198.3
u,No more free checked bags at the jetway.#apr.1198.4
u,I agree.#apr.1202.0
u,I support banning peanuts ONLY ON FLIGHTS where a passenger with a peanut allergy requests.#apr.1203.0
u,For the vast majority of us, peanuts are a cheap, healthy and easy to transport food, offering happiness in a cramped and tedious journey.#apr.1203.1
u,Without my peanuts and GandT, I don't know if I'd fly!#apr.1203.2
n,Government travel is at a required place and time.#apr.1206.0
e,Mt last trip to Ft. Irwin.  My ticket was to Corona Airport in Califonir#apr.1206.1
e,but by the time the agent figured it out, the plane was full#apr.1206.2
e,note that this wa a pprepaid Goventment ticket.#apr.1206.3
u,I then drow home to wait for my office to open and figure out what happened.#apr.1206.4
e,Confirmation was made that I had a seat on the fight.#apr.1206.5
e,By this time I missed my original fight#apr.1206.6
e,and all flights to my original destinatin were totally full.#apr.1206.7
e,I was then offered a booking to Las Vegas#apr.1206.8
e,which I accepted after the base agree to send a car and driver to pick me up in Las Vegas.#apr.1206.9
e,I confirmed with the airline  that my return trip to California and Corondo#apr.1206.10
e,On my return, after being driven by base car and drive and requiring the extra expense of a overnight in a hotel, I arrive early the next day and was told that United had changed my ticked to Las Vegas.#apr.1206.11
e,This time there was room on a later fight for me.#apr.1206.12
e,End of story is that it cost tax payers' money for the airlines to not accommotate reserved government training.#apr.1206.13
u,Solution is that USG travelers on businss should have guaranted seats.#apr.1206.14
u,In addition, I missing my initial trainingg and had to pay for the extra overnight myself.#apr.1206.15
u,Solution:  airlines should pay for overnights asw the esult of their mistakes.#apr.1206.16
u,Fortunately this is the worst example I can give..some third world ones are worse!.#apr.1206.17
u,We can all get by on a pretzel if needed to protect other passengers.#apr.1210.0
u,Zones are impossible to control as anyone on the overcrowded flights can attest to,#apr.1210.1
u,and who has not seen children trailed by parents toddling up the aisle a long way from the zone that is their assigned seat.#apr.1210.2
u,I would rather have the attendants worry about flight safety issues than corralling familes or travelers in zones to enable someone to satisfy a peanut craving during the hour or so they are on the flight.#apr.1210.3
u,Full, transparent, and clear pricing as part of assisted and on-line sales so people can not purchase a ticket until they have affirmatively rejected or accepted some ot the add-ons.#apr.1212.0
u,As long a people do not see or do not care to see them the airlines can slip them in after the option to buy from another carrier is past.#apr.1212.1
u,By forcing the issue up front you can decide at the time of purchase if you want to pay for the services being charged.#apr.1212.2
u,I believe advertised fares should state the entire price, including fees, taxes, etc.#apr.1220.0
u,Fares cannot be advertised as one way if the price is only valid with roundtrip fares.#apr.1220.1
u,These rules should apply to everyone who sells tickets.#apr.1220.2
u,Post purchase price increases should not be allowed.#apr.1220.3
u,Optional services should be offered on an opt-in basis.#apr.1220.4
u,Sad but true, I think airlines will need to have minimum customer service standards dictated to them.#apr.1224.0
u,Yes to all of the proposed solutions by DOT.#apr.1224.1
u,TWO hours should be the maximum delay on a tramac.#apr.1225.0
u,Health issues as well as overuse of restroom facilities before the trip is finally completed are major issues.  Water should always be available to waiting passengars.#apr.1225.1
u,If the delay is weather related it is out of the carriers control,#apr.1225.2
u,but IF it is MAINTENANCE related, then all passengars should be given compensation.#apr.1225.3
u,Without having to pay compensation  the carriers have no incentative to ado their best.#apr.1225.4
u,Ban peanuts and tree nuts on all flights.#apr.1226.0
u,I think we are all looking in the wrong direction on this issue.#apr.1227.0
u,Instead of agonizing over any set of compensation for bumping rules, the solution, with explanation later here, is: NO BUMPING!#apr.1227.1
u,No bumping could only happen with another solution: NO OVERSELLING!#apr.1227.2
u,Yes, of course, given certain conditions that could be applied to ALL flights.#apr.1227.3
u,An airplane flight is no different than any other event, let's say like a concert.#apr.1227.4
u,Once the concert promoter sells all his seat inventory, he's done.#apr.1227.5
u,He collects his money and moves on.#apr.1227.6
u,Same can apply for any air flight.#apr.1227.7
u,Let the airline sell all his inventory of seats and be done.#apr.1227.8
u,Let them count their money and move on.#apr.1227.9
u,Once they buy that ticket, they are also done.#apr.1227.10
u,In fairness and to offset the airlines' position, at this point the airline would not have to offer up unused ticket credits,#apr.1227.11
u,they do not have to calculate outrageous ticket change fee's ,#apr.1227.12
u,they do not have to determine a specific amount of monetary credit to any bumped passenger....#apr.1227.13
u,there would be none!!!#apr.1227.14
u,Remember, if you buy that ticket to the concert and don't make it,#apr.1227.15
u,no concert company is going to give you your money back.#apr.1227.16
u,But this concept could spawn another business, such as one that would insure you if you miss your flight for other than being bumped reasons.#apr.1227.17
u,That company could take ALL of the costs involved into consideration  before giving you a premium that would cover the risk.#apr.1227.18
u,That calculation is available well before the time that any passenger would miss a flight,#apr.1227.19
u,so there's no last minute figuring that would have to take place.#apr.1227.20
u,So, that's it.#apr.1227.21
u,NO OVERBOOKING.#apr.1227.22
u,NO CREDITS OF ANY KIND FOR MISSING THE FLIGHT.#apr.1227.23
u,NO MORE PROBLEMS!!#apr.1227.24
n,The airlines sell mostly non refundable tickets these days,#apr.1229.0
u,therefore they still get paid for no-shows.#apr.1229.1
u,I suggest NOT allowing overbooking, but allowing travelers to go to the airport and take a chance on getting a no-show seat at a reduced fare.#apr.1229.2
u,The airline is still coming out ahead.#apr.1229.3
u,As a frequent flier, I appreciate the intent of this rule to provide good information to passengers.#apr.1231.0
u,My carrier of choice, Delta, generally does a good job of this and within the 30 minute time frame suggested so that seems reasonable.#apr.1231.1
u,I have 3 concerns around these issues....#apr.1231.2
n,* It is common in a delay situation to have 2 or 3 conflicting pieces of information - one on the airport boards , one on the gate information screen , and then a third version when I call the airline or receive an update text.#apr.1231.3
u,I'd like the rule to include as much as possible the notion of consistent information.#apr.1231.4
u,* My second concern is that when a delayed departure or arrival time is provided, the quality of that information can vary greatly.#apr.1231.5
u,If you're waiting for a plane that's already in the air, the time is probably pretty good.#apr.1231.6
u,If the plane is still on the ground, that time is generally more subject to change.#apr.1231.7
u,If you're waiting for crew, you're stuck if not at a hub,#apr.1231.8
u,but someone else can often be found at a hub so a delayed time may be moved earlier again.#apr.1231.9
e,On a recent flight, we were delayed about 2 hours on the tarmac.#apr.1232.0
e,The crew did a good job of keeping us updated every 15 - 20 minutes, if only to say they didn't know anything new.#apr.1232.1
u,[the issue was weather elsewhere]#apr.1232.2
u,I was concerned when the pilot announced we would return to the gate if anyone wanted to deplane - losing our place in line, disrupting connections even more, etc.#apr.1232.3
u,I realize there are medical issues which are emergencies -#apr.1232.4
u,I'm not talking about those.#apr.1232.5
u,I agree with the 3 hour rule in principle and think it's reasonable to extend it to more airports and all airlines -#apr.1232.6
u,I actually think passengers should have less control than we apparently had in this setting.#apr.1232.7
u,As a frequent traveler, I was not aware I could request compensation in cash or check rather than a travel voucher.#apr.1233.0
u,While I don't want a lengthy announcement of fine print,#apr.1233.1
u,basic clarification under sections 5 and 6 here make sense to me.#apr.1233.2
u,Advertised prices should include all costs, including baggage, etc.#apr.1235.0
n,A total cost can go down if a passenger is exempt from checked baggage fees or a seat request fee#apr.1235.1
u,but it may not go up by adding these fees.#apr.1235.2
u,All charges should be OPT IN, not OPT OUT.#apr.1235.3
u,Code share fees should be based on the airline from whom I purchased the ticket#apr.1236.0
u,- if I purchase a DL ticket but one segment is operated by AA ,#apr.1236.1
u,I should fly under Delta's rules, not American's.#apr.1236.2
u,A ticket receipt should list any additional charges which might be incurred during the itinerary - seat reservations, baggage, snacks, pillows, etc - with a window to cancel without penalty  after this is presented.#apr.1236.3
u,All proposals are reasonable and should apply to all carriers and all agencies  who are involved for fees, delay history, etc#apr.1237.0
u,While I enjoy peanuts and have no allergy,#apr.1238.0
u,I am severely allergic to dogs and have had asthma attacks when assistance animals or pets are seated near me.#apr.1238.1
u,I also suffer when those around me have on too much perfume or too strongly scented soap or body products.#apr.1238.2
u,While I appreciate the seriousness of peanut allergies,#apr.1238.3
u,if we're going here, let's go here for all allergies.#apr.1238.4
u,* The tarmac delay limit should apply to all commercial passenger flights.#apr.1239.0
u,Being stuck on a hot, stinking plane is what is no matter the size of the plane, no matter who owns it.#apr.1239.1
u,* The tarmac delay rule should apply to airports as well as airlines.#apr.1239.2
u,* Making the delay interval part of the rules of carriage is less important than making sure excessive tarmac delays don't happen.#apr.1239.3
u,Both airports and airlines should return delayed planes to the terminal as a matter of course.#apr.1239.4
u,* Three hours is still too long.#apr.1239.5
e,As it happens, I have arthritis#apr.1239.6
u,which is sometimes aggravated when I sit with my knees sharply bent.#apr.1239.7
u,In three hours I might well be in intense pain#apr.1239.8
u,so I avoid long flights anyway.#apr.1239.9
u,If I were writing this rule, I'd say one hour is the maximum permissible delay.#apr.1239.10
u,Caps should be eliminated.#apr.1242.0
u,Proposed compensation caps should be equal to no more or less than the normal cost of the ticket plus $100.#apr.1242.1
u,Passengers bumped any size aircraft should be compensated.#apr.1242.2
u,There should be no such thing as a zero fare#apr.1242.3
u,the seat value should be placed at the normal fare or with the same number of frequent flyer miles as was used to book the ticket.#apr.1242.4
u,The best time for giving passengers information about volunteering should be 10-15 minutes prior to departure.#apr.1242.5
u,Moderator - The quote illustrates the idea that the DOT should NOT ban peanuts because you are doing exactly the same kind of things the quote covers in an attempt to achieve something for those not willing to take the responsibility themselves.#apr.1246.0
u,Do NOT ban peanut products unless you are willing to go the VERY many roads of banning other substances as well.#apr.1246.1
u,Once again, a reaction "not severe enough to...".#apr.1247.0
u,Here is the problem.#apr.1247.1
n,No one has ever died on an airplane from a peanut allergy.#apr.1247.2
u,The problem that the DOT is trying to fix here doesn't exist.#apr.1247.3
n,People have all kinds of allergic reactions in all kinds of places#apr.1247.4
e,but I don't know of anyone dying from ANY allergic reaction onboard an airplane.#apr.1247.5
u,Moderator - The problem is if you ban any food product you've just opened the door to ban every food product, perfumes, and an uncountable number of other things.#apr.1248.0
u,Regulated bans always result in follow-on bans#apr.1248.1
u,which steadily increase restrictions for problems that are better solved by individual responsibility vice government rules.#apr.1248.2
u,And that's the REAL problem. "...let's go here for all allergies."#apr.1251.0
u,I've said it before and statements like that just reinforce what I have been saying.#apr.1251.1
u,Once you ban one thing you will be required to ban a LOT more things going forward.#apr.1251.2
u,I don't think the DOT is prepared to ban all perfumes, deodorants, service animals, people who smell of smoke, people who use certain shampoo, and on and on and on.#apr.1251.3
u,I agree with JDwyer.#apr.1252.0
u,There should be ONE rule  for ALL FLIGHTS -#apr.1252.1
u,and that should be a maximum of 3 hours with food, water, bathroom available after 2 hours -#apr.1252.2
u,and airlines should be financially penalized for every passenger on the flight if they disregard the rule -#apr.1252.3
u,and the penalty should be stiff and evenly applied.#apr.1252.4
u,Might get their attention and some results.#apr.1252.5
u,I agree with mthort1 about a baggage carry-on rule that is the same at all US airports and strictly enforced.#apr.1253.0
u,In addition, these baggage and other fees are ridiculous and need to be regulated.#apr.1253.1
u,While I agree with charging for more than 1 checked bag under X lb. weight,#apr.1253.2
u,all other extra fees should be forbidden.#apr.1253.3
u,If that does not happen, airlines definitely must tell customers when booking what fees are#apr.1253.4
u,- and they should NEVER include a fee for water or a certain-size carry-on or to use the toilet!!#apr.1253.5
u,ALL carriers should list ALL separate fees and show the minimum full fare price.#apr.1253.6
u,Simply put, the total price is the only price that matters.#apr.1254.0
u,Breaking the price out needlessly confuses the issue.#apr.1254.1
u,Personally I think that if the airlines are going to charge for checked bags they should EXPECT that passengers will try to get away with the largest carry-on they can get away with.#apr.1264.0
u,With that in mind they should actually enforce the carry-on size limits BEFORE passengers board.#apr.1264.1
u,Perhaps establish official size dimensions for carry-ons and make an official "carry-on" friendly icon, like TSA did for laptop bags that can go thru scanners without having to take the laptop out.#apr.1264.2
u,A traveler should be able to know the full price of the ticket with all optional services included as he searches for a flight.#apr.1267.0
u,This could be accomplished by presenting a list of all optional services on the first reservation page.#apr.1267.1
u,The traveler would check off the optional services desired and the fares presented for the itinerary would include these so that a reasonable comparison could be made between airlines.#apr.1267.2
u,I think that 30 minutes would be appropriate for notification.#apr.1268.0
u,However, my concern would be for how this would work in changing conditions.#apr.1268.1
u,For example, if a mechanical problem is fixed faster than expected.#apr.1268.2
u,I agree with some of the others,#apr.1279.0
u,they should not be telling people they cannot get off the plane.#apr.1279.1
e,I am tall with back problems,#apr.1279.2
u,flying is already a pain in the neck,#apr.1279.3
u,sitting more time on the tarmac just makes matters worse.#apr.1279.4
u,Their should be a place where passengers are allowed off, but are not allowed to associate with ground crew for security reasons.#apr.1279.5
u,Being trapped in a plane even for an hour on the ground is not fun,#apr.1279.6
u,nor is it necessary most of the time.#apr.1279.7
u,Three hours is way too long!#apr.1279.8
u,An hour is already difficult.#apr.1279.9
u,The size of the airport does not matter,#apr.1279.10
u,as stated before by others, the feeling is the same.#apr.1279.11
u,The time limit should be no more than 30 minutes.#apr.1279.12
n,People have health problems or muscle and bone issues cannot stay seated that long.#apr.1279.13
e,One recent youtube video I saw there was no A or C, no water, could not get up, etc.#apr.1279.14
u,That is ridiculous.#apr.1279.15
u,30 minutes! If it is over 30 minutes the plane goes back to the terminal#apr.1279.16
u,and everyone who wants to get off can,#apr.1279.17
u,they just have to stay in the confines of the terminal and not to be late to reboard the flight.#apr.1279.18
u,The airline also needs to stay on top of things and let people know how long they will need to wait at the gate.#apr.1279.19
u,A flight many years ago, the airline was smart,#apr.1279.20
u,they told us to wait in the terminal, for 2 more hours due to where we were flying to was too crowded,#apr.1279.21
u,I was much happier in the terminal than having to sit in the plane for two hours.#apr.1279.22
u,Kudos to them!#apr.1279.23
u,* 30 minutes as stated earlier. Period, no excuses.#apr.1279.24
u,* No, because 30 minutes or back to the gate.#apr.1279.25
u,* No idea what you mean by this.#apr.1279.26
n,Either it is or it is not.#apr.1279.27
u,Put everyone in a separate place that they cannot leave the terminal or gate area,#apr.1279.28
u,it is not that difficult,#apr.1279.29
u,it is not rocket science here..#apr.1279.30
u,Passengers should be allowed off anytime with out anyone having to tell us we can, period.#apr.1279.31
u,We should not be mandated to sit for hours and hours.#apr.1279.32
u,All airports should have places for this,#apr.1279.33
u,go back to the gate#apr.1279.34
u,and let us get off and wait in the terminal at the gate so that security is not compromised.#apr.1279.35
u,Whatever protects us is ok with me.#apr.1281.0
u,I just don't want more fees added for whatever the changes are.#apr.1281.1
e,I fly international a lot,#apr.1281.2
u,and I am not really sure what you are asking of us..#apr.1281.3
u,All fees should be shown on the initial screen showing a price or in any ad showing a fare.#apr.1292.0
u,That said, I would prefer the rule to be that airlines return to the standard of several years ago.#apr.1292.1
u,Any flight to, from or within the US includes 2 bags of up to 70lb. and a carry on in the standard 22 inch size.#apr.1292.2
u,My worst experiences with notifications have been "after hours" at some airports,#apr.1293.0
u,when most of the staffs have left and nobody seems to be minding the store.#apr.1293.1
e,I arrive to pick up someone from a flight and cannot even get info on the status boards by the gates or security.#apr.1293.2
u,So, yes, I think airlines should keep up their end of the deal until all their flights are FINISHED for the day!#apr.1293.3
u,If flights are late coming or going, airline staff need to stay with it.#apr.1293.4
u,I find it interesting that the moderator keeps saying the DOT will consider carry on rules in the future.#apr.1294.0
n,The fact is there ARE current carry on rules in effect.#apr.1294.1
n,Sadly the CURRENT carry on rules ARE NOT ENFORCED!#apr.1294.2
u,A great start would be to ENFORCE the current rules.#apr.1294.3
u,This needs to happen AT THE SECURITY CHECKPOINT,#apr.1294.4
u,so that those who need to check luggage are easily directed back to the airline's ticket counter.#apr.1294.5
u,As far as the multiple, and seemingly never ending array of fees that the airlines are charging, yes, these fees should be prominently displayed as part of the ticket purchase process.#apr.1294.6
u,The customer should be required to acknowledge their understanding of the fees before the ticket purchase is completed.#apr.1294.7
u,Perhaps those writing the rules need to check the websites for Ryan Air , EasyJet , or Flybe .#apr.1294.8
u,As the customer navigates these sites, as part of the ticket purchase process they are asked to select additional items they are interested in.#apr.1294.9
u,For example, when they select to check a bag, the bottom line price goes up,  same for fees for early boarding, sporting equipment, and the like.#apr.1294.10
u,The ticket purchase, and the additional fees are then lumped into a single transaction.#apr.1294.11
u,In this scenario, no advanced notice of changes in the fees would be required, if once the fee is paid, it cannot be changed.#apr.1294.12
u,Personally, I believe that EVERY airline ticket should include the first checked bag.#apr.1294.13
u,This would simplify security, and help alleviate the problems with the carry on luggage.#apr.1294.14
u,I also believe that unless the passenger does not meet the check in time limit for checked luggage, that all fees charged for the transport of that luggage should be immediately refunded to the original form of payment if the luggage does not arrive with the passenger.#apr.1294.15
u,The regulations, once they are developed should apply to all carriers, no matter size of the plane.#apr.1294.16
u,No reason to increase the complexity by making exceptions or differences based on the size of the company or size of the plane.#apr.1294.17
u,The services should cost the same on code share flights, regardless of which carrier is operating the flight.#apr.1294.18
u,I have sympathy for those with peanut allergies,#apr.219.0
u,but banning peanuts from flights via a DOT regulation seems to go too far.#apr.219.1
u,Perhaps advocacy groups for those who are peanut-allergic will approach the major carriers to voluntarily set aside seating blocks that are reserved for allergy sufferers, and non-sufferers who are willing to agree not to eat peanuts while sitting in that particular block.#apr.219.2
u,As someone who suffers from a medical condition which requires me to carry my "rescue" medication with me everywhere I go, I think that if the risk to an allergy sufferer is deemed to be significant, then they should  consider alternate travel methods other than flying,  ensure they have sufficient "rescue" medication to last the entire time they might be stuck in an aircraft, and  they should wear appropriate clothing  or  face masks to minimize exposed skin and inhalation risk.#apr.219.3
u,Requiring other passengers to forgo their "right" to eat peanuts so as to accommodate the "right" of allergy sufferers to fly seems a bit much, particularly if the allergy sufferers don't fly often, anyway.#apr.219.4
n,Airlines do not use uniform presentation of taxes and fees, especially fuel surcharges.#apr.139.0
n,Some airlines break out fuel surcharge when taxes or fees itemization is requested.#apr.139.1
n,Other airlines include fuel surcharge in basic fare,#apr.139.2
n,so its amount is concealed.#apr.139.3
u,All airlines should be required to present fuel surcharge separately, along with other taxes or fees details.#apr.139.4
u,The itemization should also apply to foreign carriers who fly into the USA.#apr.139.5
n,Some claim to passengers that they don't know what the itemized taxes or fees are.#apr.139.6
u,Airlines should be required to clearly distinguish among taxes, government-imposed fees and surcharges.#apr.139.7
n,Some airlines currently label as "taxes" fees and surcharges they themselves impose.#apr.139.8
u,The airline should compensate passengers who get bumped the full fare it would cost at that particular point of time for the customer to buy a ticket on that airplane.#apr.132.0
u,Otherwise, airlines will bump passengers who paid a lower fare.#apr.132.1
u,As a result, for example, if I paid $200 for a ticket and a different passenger paid $800 for a seat on the same airplane and class of service, the airline would have a clear incentive to bump me and not the other passenger - all else equal.#apr.132.2
u,In addition, the airline should compensate the bumped individual for the time they wasted because the airline bumped them.#apr.132.3
u,One imperfect way to set a fair amound could be to divide the individual's salary by 40 h or wk and 50 work weeks per year.#apr.132.4
u,There must be a complete ban on tree nuts and peanuts on planes.#apr.217.0
n,It is a closed space.#apr.217.1
e,I am allergic to peanuts and almonds#apr.217.2
n,and I am impacted every time I fly.#apr.217.3
n,A nut free zone does not work#apr.217.4
n,since the dust from nuts gets in the closed air system of the plane.#apr.217.5
u,For the time that people are on planes there should be consideration of others who have no control as to the reactions they have to nuts.#apr.217.6
n,For almost all other foods the allergy only occurs if the food is ingested#apr.217.7
n,so you can easily avoid the allergic reaction but not eating the food.#apr.217.8
n,This is not true for many of us with nut allergies -#apr.217.9
n,we react if other people are eating the food#apr.217.10
n,since it is an airborne allergy.#apr.217.11
e,I do fly#apr.217.12
n,but I have to take multiple Benadryl pills every 4 hours to keep from reacting to the airborne dust of the nuts.#apr.217.13
n,This works for now#apr.217.14
u,but I always wonder when it will no longer be enough.#apr.217.15
u,An epipen is not the answer#apr.217.16
n,as it lasts only look enough for the plane to land#apr.217.17
u,which is not a practical solution when you are flying on a long flight over water and would certainly be a much greater inconvenience to the other passengers than a ban on nut products on planes if the plane was able to land.#apr.217.18
u,The rules airlines have are ridiculous -#apr.217.19
n,Southwest is not nut free#apr.217.20
n,they will not serve nuts#apr.217.21
u,but if you fly a late flight the peanuts are all over the floor and seats.#apr.217.22
n,Some other airlines have the rows around you 'nut free'#apr.217.23
n,but advise you they can do nothing if the person seated next to you brings nuts on and wants to eat them.#apr.217.24
n,Other airlines with advance notice will not serve nuts#apr.217.25
n,but all airlines allow passengers to bring on foods including nuts and will not stop the person from eating them if they wish to.#apr.217.26
n,So you can have a 'nut free' flight#apr.217.27
n,and the person sitting next to you can take out their package of peanuts and eat away -#apr.217.28
u,and the airlines will do nothing to help you.#apr.217.29
u,Again all nuts should be banned from airplanes#apr.217.30
u,unless it is your own private plane - then go ahead and eat what you want.#apr.217.31
u,As someone who carries an epipen for beestings,  I understand that allergies can be serious and life threatening.#apr.192.0
u,Banning airlines from serving peanuts inflight seems reasonable;#apr.192.1
e,several posts mention the risk inherent in many people opening bags of peanuts at one time  throwing a large amount of dust in the air,#apr.192.2
n,which could be enough to trigger an allergy in severely allergic people.#apr.192.3
u,I find this interesting that DOT or FAA would talk about something that affect only one  percent of whole population who are allergic to peanut.#apr.631.0
u,On other hand, the DOT or FAA has not demonstrate any improvement or collaborate with National Association of the Deaf  to improve subtitle  or  captioning on ALL TV programming, entertainment, and on everything that are being shown in any aircraft.#apr.631.1
n,Right now - the only thing is captioned is safety.#apr.631.2
n,With this inaccessibility to deaf, hard of hearing, and other people who depends on subtitle represent ten  percent of whole population.#apr.631.3
u,I know this awareness had brought on to DOT or FAA and many of other airlines carriers about this for years#apr.631.4
e,as I recalled my first complaint was back in early 1990's -#apr.631.5
n,nothing has been done about it.#apr.631.6
u,Now a peanut had gotten your attention -#apr.631.7
u,its a peanut issue in oppose to accessibility issue where lots of deaf and hard of hearing people pay same amount of air fare tickets as all other people and nothing has been done about it.#apr.631.8
u,We need a solution here in regards to accessibility.#apr.631.9
u,As an infrequent traveler, I get easily confused with all the new fees and regulations.#apr.1219.0
u,When I'm comparison shopping, I'd like to see additional fees listed on every webpage of every airline or ticket provider#apr.1219.1
u,I love Amazon's page that shows cost and shipping.#apr.1219.2
u,I think we need something like that for airfares.#apr.1219.3
u,It's pretty deceptive for one airline to list an all inclusive fee  and another to unbundle just to look like they have a lower price.#apr.1219.4
u,I'm not a travel agent and don't want to spend hours looking for the best deal, only to find hidden charges.#apr.1219.5
u,I hate to see this become ANOTHER federal regulation,#apr.1219.6
u,but it would be good business.#apr.1219.7
u,In terms of code share, the rules or fees of the issuing airline should prevail across the board.#apr.1219.8
u,For sure oversales or bumping compensation needs to be adjusted for inflation and zero-fare passengers compensated in miles plus cash for extra money paid.#apr.1257.0
u,Smaller aircraft should also be held responsible.#apr.1257.1
u,I have no problem with the new regulations,#apr.46.0
n,Sometimes some delays are due to passengers.#apr.46.1
u,Everyone gets upset about a delay#apr.46.2
u,As far as overbooking is concerned, perhaps the airlines would not overbook if the DOT required that airline tickets purchased are "use them or lose them" or carry an instant penalty - meaning the value of the ticket is instantly reduced by 50%.#apr.46.3
n,The airline can't afford to have empty seats,#apr.46.4
n,yet people just don't show up or make last minute change costing the airline which ultimately costs other passengers.#apr.46.5
u,Everyone has to realize there is going to be a cost to the consumer if there is a cost to the airline.#apr.46.6
u,I also would like to see minimum standards set for leg and arm room done by the DOT.#apr.46.7
n,It may help some of the irritation that comes with flying.#apr.46.8
u,It is long past time that the airlines treat passengers, their primary source of income, as customers they cherish and not the nuisance we've become.#apr.47.0
n,It has been said that new fees and penalties will only be passed to the passenger already struggling with higher fares and convenience fees of all kinds.#apr.47.1
u,Passengers need to remember that the airlines are still a competitive environment.#apr.47.2
u,If you don't like the fare, go elsewhere or fine some other mode of transportation.#apr.47.3
u,Southwest has been a shining example of what the legacy airlines should look forward to if they don't treat customers right.#apr.47.4
u,I've also found plenty of international airlines far more willing to treat me well on those coveted long haul flights and have completely refused to fly any American airlines on a long haul out of the country as a result.#apr.47.5
u,They've lost my business#apr.47.6
u,and until they lose more, they may never learn.#apr.47.7
u,They should be allowed to go out of business#apr.47.8
u,and let someone else without the legacy problems to have a go at it.#apr.47.9
u,American consumers deserve better.#apr.47.10
u,Until then, it's Air France or Lufthansa for me!#apr.47.11
u,I personally think that airlines should be able to price "a la carte"#apr.55.0
u,as price discrimination  tends to benefit everyone.#apr.55.1
u,Baggage fees are an exception, though.#apr.55.2
u,Airlines are incentivized to charge baggage fees#apr.55.3
n,so they can post lower base prices.#apr.55.4
n,In turn this encourages fliers to cram luggage in the cabin,#apr.55.5
u,which is irritating to say the least.#apr.55.6
u,But the issue is that it seems unreasonable to expect travelers to fly without any luggage.#apr.55.7
u,Discriminatory pricing should be truly discriminatory* like seat location, not luggage and bathrooms and water.#apr.55.8
u,Airfare should include at least one free checked bag.#apr.55.9
u,If all fares were somewhat higher as a result, the damage to an airline's bottom line should be minimized.#apr.55.10
u,1 Size of aircraft should be irrelevant.#apr.56.0
e,I was trapped on a very small  aircraft, in the hot summer sun, for hours, with no ventilation.#apr.56.1
u,Outrageous!#apr.56.2
u,Being cooked in a small tin can is no better than being cooked in a big one!#apr.56.3
u,I have two children with multiple severe food allergies.#apr.65.0
u,I support a ban on any food with peanut ingredients on airplanes actual peanut ingredients in the actual ingredient list should be banned .#apr.65.1
e,Presently We only fly airlines that do not serve peanuts or agree to not serve it on our flight .#apr.65.2
u,although, once on a southwest flight my daughter had a mild reaction.#apr.65.3
e,We think it was from residue from the previous flight.#apr.65.4
u,it was mild enough that benadryl was sufficient to control the symptoms.#apr.65.5
u,Individuals with severe allergies typically carry their own emergency medical kit .#apr.65.6
u,I wouldn't expect the airline to provide the emergency medical equipment.#apr.65.7
e,we carry ours wherever we go at all times.#apr.65.8
u,Agreed.#apr.82.0
u,The most frustrating thing about airline travel is the lack of space.#apr.82.1
u,I don't see why they care so much about letting people game the bumping system, but not at all about personal space.#apr.82.2
u,I guess the big question is,#apr.82.3
u,Buffer zones do not help in common areas like bathrooms.#apr.83.0
n,Also, that means that the persons prior to the flight ate peanuts there.#apr.83.1
e,I mentioned on another discussion board that the flight crew pointed my son out and told passengers they could not have Peanut MandMs#apr.83.2
e,because my son had an allergy.#apr.83.3
u,The passengers were all nice about it#apr.83.4
u,but it made me very uncomfortable.#apr.83.5
u,I have seen people be really nasty about asking them not to do something because fo someone else.#apr.83.6
u,All airfare costs should include the passenger's right to check at least one standard piece of baggage.#apr.84.0
u,All fees should be fully disclosed at the time of airfare purchase, regardless of nature .#apr.84.1
u,Any changes in fees should be identified by air carriers at least 6 months prior to taking effect.#apr.84.2
u,Fees must be paid according to the carrier selling the airfare, not to the one providing the service, as in the case of a code-sharing agreement.#apr.84.3
u,I believe these caps should benefit the consumers who are taken advantage of by the airlines.#apr.99.0
u,However, I agree with another poster.#apr.99.1
u,Getting the funds in airline "dollars" doesn't help those who travel infrequently and who expected  to be on a flight to get to their destination.#apr.99.2
u,As far as zero-fare tickets, they should have a choice between a cash refund  or airline miles doubled.#apr.99.3
n,This way if it were the travelers "last flight" for years, or ever, they can still be compensated for their "contract" with the airline being broke.#apr.99.4
u,That's crazy.#apr.108.0
e,I have a young son who is beyond Class 6 for peanuts or tree nuts.#apr.113.0
e,For him, it simply is not a matter of "passing up" on a snack.#apr.113.1
e,Anaphylaxis can happen much more readily for him by the transfer of oils .#apr.113.2
n,It can also happen by airborne dust.#apr.113.3
u,In a flight where peanuts are being served and all 100and bags go POOF at the same time they are opened - well, let's just say it would be a mother's nightmare.#apr.113.4
u,Especialy with recycled cabin air.#apr.113.5
u,Even without a peanut allergy, peanuts are just such a choking hazard for any small children.#apr.113.6
u,There are plenty of reasonable alternatives.#apr.113.7
u,I recall when my son was first diagnosed, 1 week prior to Christmas.#apr.113.8
e,Our pediatrician called us at all of our nighttime emergency numbers just to ensure we wouldn't step onto any holiday airline flights without an epi-pen and proper documentation of his condition.#apr.113.9
u,I was FLOORED to f sind out that Delta still served peanuts.#apr.113.10
n,Peanut allergy is unlike some other food allergies in that there are multiple ways to have reaction .#apr.113.11
u,My suggestion would be to ban peanut products on all airlines.#apr.113.12
u,But that still does not or will  not control what snacks others bring on.#apr.113.13
u,So I would suggest they still offer peanut free buffer zones and have some method of ensuring passengers in those rows are aware of what that means .#apr.113.14
u,I also think that pre-boarding should be an option,#apr.113.15
u,so that peanut families can go and wipe down the tray tables or arm rests themselves and feel comfortable with the environment in which their child will be sitting.#apr.113.16
e,I've been on one too many flights were peanuts have been banned simply due to an allergic person flying...#apr.113.17
u,and I feel SO MUCH sympathy for those families,#apr.113.18
u,because the airline staff does not seem to be good at respecting their privacy.#apr.113.19
u,In fact, they almost act begruding or point out the poor child to other.#apr.113.20
u,In all honesty, I can't see making the switch to peanut free snacks to be that big an impact to the airlines.#apr.113.21
u,As long as items are clearly labeled  are o.k.#apr.113.22
u,If nothing else, I am so very appreciative that this issue is gaining attention.#apr.113.23
u,I don't think airlines realize how many passengers don't fly them due to their poor policies.#apr.113.24
u,In fact, I learned so much already today reading these message boards.#apr.113.25
u,I will make it a point to frequent the airlines  where people seem to have had really positive and supportive environments when flying with their children.#apr.113.26
u,Great info for me to have as a parent.#apr.113.27
u,I also wonder if you couldn't look into how the major sports arenas handle peanut allergies.#apr.113.28
u,Most will offer at least one "peanut free" day so that children can enjoy major league sports like baseball etc.#apr.113.29
n,So it can be done.#apr.113.30
n,And they have WAY more people in one arena than on a single flight.#apr.113.31
u,The allergic community is so grateful that you are allowing our voices to be heard.#apr.123.0
u,The decision you are considering could save many lives.#apr.123.1
u,From the bottom of my heart, anything you need or want to know please ask.#apr.123.2
u,We fly out of a small airport on small feeder planes marked as related to USAIR, Delta, and soon American.#apr.130.0
n,Whenever there is a tie up at the hub, these are the planes that have to sit ...#apr.130.1
n,their takeoff is predicated on space for them to land at ATL and CLT.#apr.130.2
u,I think these carriers should be under the same regs. as the big boys.#apr.130.3
u,I agree with CLT_PASS,#apr.1029.0
u,all the proposed customer service requirements  and the five bullet points under "additional standards DOT should be considering, are appropriate.#apr.1029.1
u,They should apply to foreign carriers anywhere DOT has enforcement jurisdiction.#apr.1029.2
u,Baggage delay beyond 2 hours should certainly be long enough to be not delivered on time", with the proviso that a "late checkin"  of the bag by the passenger would relieve the airline of that strict deadline.#apr.1029.3
u,A "significant delay" under the third bullet point, allowing refund of any type of ticket, should be specified,#apr.1029.4
u,and 3 hours seems reasonable for any flight regardless of duration.#apr.1029.5
u,Late bags ought to have any baggage fees refunded.#apr.1029.6
u,The idea that at least one bag checked be included in all fares would improve safety in the cabin, given our current situation with large, heavy bags jammed into overhead bins or under seats to avoid fees.#apr.1029.7
u,Customer service plans and standards should be part of the written contract of carriage,#apr.1029.8
u,so passengers have written commitments to compare among different carriers when choosing with whom to fly.#apr.1029.9
u,Totally in agreement.#apr.133.0
u,It would appear that airlines are now making more money from the "taxes and other fees" than from the "fare" portion of what we pay them.#apr.133.1
u,Online travel agent services like Expedia, Travelocity or Orbitz should be required to show the full cost including all applicable taxes.#apr.133.2
n,The European Union already requires that airlines post FULL prices, including taxes or fees, at the very first presentation of fares.#apr.137.0
n,This is required for flights originating in Europe.#apr.137.1
n,American airlines respect this rule when a passenger enters their foreign-based web site,#apr.137.2
n,but airlines do not respect the rule when a passenger books the same flight  from the USA version of the airline's web site.#apr.137.3
n,This can be verified on Continental.com by selecting the country  at the top right of the web page and simulating a booking out of a European city.#apr.137.4
u,Rule should require US airlines to show full fare regardless of which web site version is used.#apr.137.5
n,Prior to the implementation of passenger facility fees in the 1990s, domestic prices did include all taxes, although occasionally certain certain city surcharges were not included.#apr.144.0
u,The industry did just fine.#apr.144.1
u,I have no  problem with a carrier charging a given fare#apr.144.2
u,but they should be honest about what the total cost of the ticket is to the passenger rather than stating a price and putting $30-$50 into  the mix at time of purchase.#apr.144.3
u,If federal excise taxes can be included, there is no reason why other taxes, fees, and surcharges cannot be part of an advertised price.#apr.144.4
u,I wholeheartedly support this proposal.#apr.144.5
u,Ideally this would cover international as well as domestic travel as taxes, fees, and surcharges on international tickets frequently add hundreds of dollars to a price quote.#apr.144.6
u,Ticket prices should include ALL fees seamlessly--no having to opt in or out or read fine print.#apr.161.0
u,We should all be able to make a reservation without worrying that we missed something and know exactly what we will pay.#apr.161.1
u,It should NEVER be OK to increase the price after a confirmed purchase--this is ludicrous!#apr.161.2
u,I do hope the DOT is very strict and across the board with their new regulations.#apr.161.3
u,Consumers are being gouged everywhere#apr.161.4
u,and it needs to stop.#apr.161.5
u,I believe this rule should apply to all air carriers.#apr.166.0
u,When you waive it for some you set up a situation which is unfair and opens unforeseen loopholes.#apr.166.1
u,3 hours is a reasonable time limit for all carriers#apr.166.2
u,and it should be a legally binding limit.#apr.166.3
u,More time than that on the tarmac is nothing more than a demonstration by the carrier that they have not planned properly and are willing to make the paying customer pay for their poor planning.#apr.166.4
u,This is just another regulation that takes basic responsibility out of people's hands.#apr.170.0
u,If you can't do the math to figure out the total cost then you probably should stay home#apr.170.1
u,since you can't figure out the tax on your purchases at stores either.#apr.170.2
u,As long as there is a requirement for a listing of the total cost before they charge you then it is up to the consumer to ASK what those other fees are.#apr.170.3
u,The airline companies should be aware of the coming flight delay before boarding.#apr.196.0
n,Holding passengers in the plane simply gives them the ability to make more money by re-using the gate for another flight.#apr.196.1
u,They can re-use the gate if the plane is taxied to the wait area and back when flight could proceed, while passengers wait in the waiting area.#apr.196.2
u,I suggest limit the duration of stay onboard to the time required to taxi the plane to a waiting area away from the gates, and back plus, say, half an hour.#apr.196.3
u,That would make it total of hour and a half to two hours maximum.#apr.196.4
n,* Although there is no direct formula,#apr.319.0
n,if there are peanut particles in the air, it is highly likely that a passenger with a severe peanut allergy will have a life-threatening reaction.#apr.319.1
n,* Complete restriction of peanut products on board a flight is the only way to effectively try to avoid this danger.#apr.319.2
n,This includes food supplied by the airlines, as well as food brought by passengers and consumed on the plane.#apr.319.3
u,* Possibly, but you certainly can't bank on it.#apr.319.4
n,Epinephrine auto-injectors are designed to temporarily open the air passages;#apr.319.5
n,they are for immediate treatment - not long term treatment.#apr.319.6
n,Although Epipens might end up staving off a reaction,#apr.319.7
n,they most frequently just buy you some time to get long term treatment at the hospital such as antihistamines, steroids, and other measures.#apr.319.8
u,* That depends.#apr.319.9
u,As parents who have a child with a severe peanut allergy, we don't go anywhere without Epipens,#apr.319.10
u,nor should anyone with a severe peanut allergy.#apr.319.11
n,However, the auto-injectors have a large needle at the end of them#apr.319.12
n,it is retracted until the injection is administered,#apr.319.13
u,and I don't know if this is currently a security issue.#apr.319.14
u,If so, and Epipens were not allowed to be carried by passengers onto a flight, it would absolutely be up to the airlines to have a stock of them on board as part of their medical supplies.#apr.319.15
u,Otherwise, if passengers with proper medical documentation were allowed to carry their prescribed Epipens, they should definitely be diligent in doing so,#apr.319.16
u,but I still think Epipens should be a standard item included with a plane's medical supplies.#apr.319.17
u,* Absolutely.#apr.319.18
u,Anything containing peanuts, such as peanut butter crackers, should be restricted, no question.#apr.319.19
n,Regarding peanut oils, theoretically, very highly refined peanut oil contains smaller amounts of peanut proteins,#apr.319.20
u,and therefore poses less of a risk.#apr.319.21
u,However, it is almost impossible to determine which food companies use what kinds of oils, how refined the oils are, and what else is involved in the manufacturing process.#apr.319.22
u,So in general, items containing peanut oils should be completely avoided.#apr.319.23
u,Look folks, it is simple.#apr.233.0
n,Airlines can't afford empty seats on expensive jets burning expensive fuel.#apr.233.1
n,If you increase their costs, they either have to reduce their overbooking or pay the extra fees.#apr.233.2
u,Either which way, they will lose more money than they already are losing.#apr.233.3
u,If they don't overbook, there will be more empty seats costing them revenue. Higher fares, even higher change ticket fees , airlines going out of business .#apr.233.4

u,I fail to see why eating peanuts in particular is seen sa a "right"#apr.258.6
u,There's no need to single out passengers if the ban is airline-wide.#apr.267.0
u,There should be written announcements when a ticket is purchased, when a passenger is checked in and a verbal announcement by the flight attendant during the safety spiel at the start of the flight.#apr.267.1
n,In the examples you give, a person can call 911 and get to a hospital within the 30 minute time-frame that 2 EpiPen doses buy you.#apr.272.0
n,On a plane, especially one going overseas, that is not an option.#apr.272.1
u,Very articulate, dadwith4.#apr.273.0
u,Eating peanuts is as much a "right" as packing a gun or smoking a cigarette.#apr.278.0
u,I have no problem requiring the airlines to give notification of any "known" delays within 30 minutes of when they become aware of it.#apr.279.0
u,BUT, being a frequent traveler, I see all sorts of problems which are unavoidable and for which the airlines will be blamed by giving such notice with the intend that some flyers may be able to delay thier trip to the airport or even the departure gate.#apr.279.1
n,I know that many times the airlines can't also know exactly when a weather hold or a maintenance issue will be rectified and that the flight is then ready to go.#apr.279.2
n,Many time it can be surprisingly faster than expected.#apr.279.3
u,The problem is that some flyers may then  wait before going to the airport, but then find that the problem was rectified sooner than expected and the flight departed.#apr.279.4
u,Of course the flyer and the flyers rights organization will then crucify the airlines for such poor planning.#apr.279.5
u,Flyers need to grow up and quit pouting and blaming everthing on the airlines.#apr.279.6
u,They can't have it both ways.#apr.279.7
e,My daughter is allergic to peanut and tree nut.#apr.285.0
n,The problem with this allergy, is that anaphylaxis can occur from ANY contact with peanut.#apr.285.1
n,This includes airborne inhalation, cross contamination with other foods, or contact with residue left from previous and nearby passengers.#apr.285.2
n,It is not simply a matter of "don't eat it."#apr.285.3
n,It is well-known that Epipens address anaphylaxis on a SHORT TERM basis.#apr.285.4
n,The effects of the Epipen last for 15 or 20 minutes,#apr.285.5
n,but if the medication wears off, the individual can resume their life-threatening reaction.#apr.285.6
n,On the ground, after the use of an Epipen, you are supposed to go immediately to the emergency room#apr.285.7
n,because you may need further treatment to save your life.#apr.285.8
n,In the air, you don't have that option.#apr.285.9
n,I believe the current diagnosis rate of peanut allergy is almost 1 in 100 children.#apr.285.10
u,That is a HUGE percentage of the population that is at risk by flying in an airplane.#apr.285.11
e,I choose not to fly because of the risk to my daughter,#apr.285.12
u,but it would be wonderful to be able to travel like everyone else again.#apr.285.13
u,I fully support this ban on any product that contains peanut.#apr.285.14
u,As a former sufferer of a 3-hour ground delay at DCA two years ago this summer, I would not will such a delay on anybody.#apr.302.0
u,The airline I was traveling on  did not provide adequate updates in my opinion, and only provided passengers with seltzer water roughly 90 minutes into the delay, and did not keep the aircraft cool using the air conditioning .#apr.302.1
e,In this airline's defense, the plane returned to the gate after 2 hours to allow for de-planing,#apr.302.2
u,Banning peanuts and peanut products on flights does not harm anyone and demonstrates the airlines'  reasonable attempt to meet the needs of those with severe peanut allergies.#apr.328.0
n,The airlines can't control what passengers bring onboard,#apr.328.1
n,but they can try to regulate it and not have an entire flight full of people eating peanuts.#apr.328.2

e,bc I experienced being stuck on the tarmac for 6and hours years ago w or o food and drink  before we had cell phones where we could call the police and or or media and make it a new story as they do.#apr.333.5
u,Not to mention, now we are expected to buy lousy airline food onboard,#apr.333.6
u,I'd rather bring my own affordable healthy snacks and meals.#apr.333.7
u,One free checked bag also prevents discrimination against those that can't physically cope with carrying luggage around an airport  and putting it in or removing it from the overhead bin.#apr.333.8
u,Airlines should meet the needs of their customers and not nickel and dime us to death.#apr.333.9
u,Compensation should be reasonable, but at least equal to the travelers' actual monitary losses plus more for inconvenience.#apr.343.0

u,but if I give my son a peanut, he could die ;#apr.364.15
e,everytime I look under his bed for the Boogey Man, there's nothing.#apr.364.16
u,It's pretty reliable data.#apr.364.17
u,Let life and death be the standard for what foods to ban,#apr.364.18
u,and no one should have a problem with this issue.#apr.364.19
u,I didn't know that there was a sizable peanut lobby,#apr.364.20
u,nor that so many Americans tie their rights, freedom, and understanding of Capitalism to their ability to eat peanuts.#apr.364.21
u,But I've always known that they love to tie their prejudices to matters they don't understand,#apr.364.22
u,and this board is proof of the reason WHY the government resorts to making laws that should be common sense and decency.#apr.364.23
n,When a food allergy is life-threatening , it considered a disability under federal laws such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act .#apr.367.0
n,In other words, people with severe peanut allergies have the right to be protected.#apr.367.1
u,This seems like another bureaucratic paperwork mess that will be outdated as soon as it is published, of little use and another cost of doing business that will raise ticket prices.#apr.382.0
u,I do NOT support this.#apr.382.1
u,I long for the day when I can book a flight for my family.#apr.418.0
u,But at the moment, that seems practically impossible#apr.418.1
e,as my 4 year old son has a severe peanut allergy.#apr.418.2
e,He has reacted in an enclosed room before.#apr.418.3
u,Thankfully, we were on land, not thousands of feet up in the air, making treatment much more feasible.#apr.418.4
u,I am terrified of being on a plane and him coming into contact with peanuts in any way shape or form.#apr.418.5
e,I have contacted airlines to see if a request could be made to keep a flight peanut free, but was advised not to fly with  them instead or to simply stand up on the flight and beg everyone not to eat peanuts during the flight.#apr.418.6
e,I have chosen not to fly.#apr.418.7
e,We live 13 hours from our family.#apr.418.8

u,I know a day will come when we need to get somewhere in a limited amount of time.#apr.418.11
u,At this point, I would have to find childcare for my son#apr.418.12
e,as he could not come with us, or not attend at all.#apr.418.13
e,My son did not choose this allergy.#apr.418.14
n,There is nothing he can do to make it go away.#apr.418.15
e,He is dependent upon other people to keep him healthy by preventing him from ingesting or inhaling any peanut product.#apr.418.16
u,In this way it is a disability.#apr.418.17
u,I remain hopeful the the DOT will ban all peanut products on flights and inform all passengers on a flight when a person with such an allergy is on board.#apr.418.18
u,I'd think the simplest answer would be that every plane needs to have an airline employee of decision making level on it.#apr.420.0
u,If they want to get off, then everyone can get off.#apr.420.1
u,Seems to me that the Captain SHOULD already be filling that role,#apr.420.2
u,so simply restore the Captain's authority to do what he feels is in the best interest of the people on his  plane without worrying about a counter-mand from a middle-manager at home in his  hot tub sipping champagne.#apr.420.3
u,If a rule is needed so that it can be empirically decided if someone should be punished, it needs to have a few 'check points'.#apr.420.4
n,After an hour without air conditioning, even a 747 can get pretty warm.#apr.420.5
u,If they want to burn jet fuel to run it, or get an external hookup to run it, that's up to them.#apr.420.6
e,I was once stuck on a flight where the airline couldn't do gate assignments,#apr.420.7
e,so ground control parked us out of the way,#apr.420.8
e,and the Captain sat there and burned jet fuel to run the AC until the company decided to figure it out.#apr.420.9
u,The wait was annoying,#apr.420.10
u,but listening to ATC on channel 9 of the in flight entertainment was VERY entertaining.#apr.420.11
u,Two hours is far too long to expect an adult to 'hold it',#apr.420.12
u,so WORKING restrooms need to be provided by then.#apr.420.13
u,Food and water needs to be determined by the length of the flight.#apr.420.14
u,If it's 30 minutes, and no meal service was planned, than a meal service needs to be performed at 30 minutes.#apr.420.15
u,If a meal service was planned, then the meal service needs to be performed on time, even if the flight is still on the ground.#apr.420.16
n,People have medical conditions that require regular intake of food.#apr.420.17
u,If they only planned for a 30 minute flight, bringing a full meal 'just in case' would be unreasonable to expect.#apr.420.18
u,3 hours is about time to give it up entirely.#apr.420.19
u,Either cancel the flight, or do a "please ring your call bell if you wish to return to the gate. Be aware that you may not be able to reboard this flight if it takes off without you."#apr.420.20
u,Again, I'd hope the Captain knows how to manage his  plane.#apr.420.21
u,They get one 'pass' on any of these limits, but no more than 30 minutes.#apr.420.22
u,If the guy at the front of the plane is making poor judgement calls about food, water, and bathroom service, than you've got far more problems than a full bladder.#apr.420.23
u,Should they ban dust on airplanes,#apr.428.0
u,They'd have to shut down air travel,#apr.428.1
n,since they wouldn't be able to allow the doors to be opened for passengers to embark or disembark due to the dust on their clothes and luggage, in the jetway, and outside the plane.#apr.428.2

u,the reaction was not severe.#apr.560.2
u,I applaud the flight attendant for singling you out -#apr.560.3
u,as a fellow traveller I would want to know who had caused MY child to not be able to have a snack on a long flight.#apr.560.4
n,Peanuts are harmless to 99.9999999% of the population.#apr.560.5
n,In that VERY small subset that are effected, actual life threatening reactions are incredibly rare.#apr.560.6
u,The traveling public should not be impacted because of your erroneous belief that this wonderful food might harm your child.#apr.560.7

n,they are private enterprise.#apr.576.1
u,If we were to adopt that level of thinking, then everyone would qualify as disabled,#apr.576.2

u,Nothing could be more delusional than that.#apr.581.3
n,No deaths due to anaphylactic shock caused by exposure to peanuts on-board an airliner have been reported in this country,#apr.581.4
n,so the possibility that it would happen remains infinitesimally small,#apr.581.5
u,though you would rather have everyone believe it's certain to happen if peanuts are served by airlines.#apr.581.6
u,Facts are stubborn things,#apr.581.7
n,and the fact is that you're more likely to be hit and killed by a car on any given day,#apr.581.8
u,but neither you nor anyone else is advocating that we ban automobiles or driving.#apr.581.9
n,Allergies to peanuts or tree nuts are not increasing;#apr.581.10
n,there is no scientific data to support such claims.#apr.581.11
n,The latest data we have for deaths from anaphylactic shock is 14 people in one year,#apr.581.12

n,Far more people die in swimming pools every year.#apr.581.14
n,Contrary to your claim, exposure to peanuts is not more likely to cause anaphylactic shock;#apr.581.15
n,it MAY cause that reaction in the worst sufferers.#apr.581.16
u,People with that condition know it and need to take responsibility for their condition when traveling by any means, including medication to prevent or reduce the severity of any reaction, face masks, and Epi-pens.#apr.581.17
u,If they won't do that, then they deserve whatever consequences come from their own negligence.#apr.581.18
u,It is not society's responsibility to be burdened with their condition.#apr.581.19
u,Even if peanuts could be banned from airliners, that would not remove the risk,#apr.581.20
n,since peanut dust, oils, and parts are already embedded in the aircraft, even though you can't see it.#apr.581.21
u,Mulder, once again you are absolutely correct.#apr.596.0
u,All the hyper-emotional arguments aside, the simple fact is,#apr.596.1
n,NOT ONE PERSON HAS EVER DIED FROM A PEANUT ON AN AIRPLANE!!!#apr.596.2
u,So, if you are so risk averse that you want to ban peanuts due to the extremely remote possibility that someone could actually be injured by one, then you really shouldn't be flying, as planes do occasionally crash.#apr.596.3
u,For that matter you shouldn't drive, walk in public, eat any kind of food, or breath the air,#apr.596.4
n,as each of these activities has a higher chance of injuring someone than ingesting a peanut.#apr.596.5

u,Plenty of times I'm not thrilled with what I am offered#apr.602.3
u,I think some of this is just outrage that someone dare put a regulation on something.#apr.602.4
u,But I don't think passengers should be banned from bringing peanut products on the flight.#apr.602.5
u,There's a compromise that can be struck.#apr.602.6
u,so I usually bring my own.#apr.625.0
u,As a fellow air traveler, I agree with some of the points you are making...#apr.625.1
u,there are some standards that people should abide by while flying on a plane.#apr.625.2
u,However, that is not the issue at hand-- peanuts on the plane are.#apr.625.3
u,While I don't always enjoy peanuts while flying, I don't believe they should be banned outright.#apr.625.4
u,I think that people who suffer from severe peanut allergies should seriously consider the possibility of peanuts being aboard planes, and should carry the appropriate medications should they be affected by an allergy.#apr.625.5
u,If the airlines want to regulate this, I believe that creating a few dedicated planes to serve as "peanut-free" flying experiences are an acceptable alternative to completely banning peanuts and peanut products on planes.#apr.625.6
u,It is not the responsibility of the government, however, to regulate the presence or absence of foods on planes.#apr.625.7
u,We have bigger issues for the government to handle, such as the aforementioned air safety issues of bringing incendiary devices on planes.#apr.625.8
u,Your argument is a strawman.#apr.644.0
u,Nobody is advocating funerals;#apr.644.1
u,you're just trying to deflect attention away from the issue, which is that there is no real risk to peanut allergy sufferers.#apr.644.2
n,And there is no scientific evidence to support your argument.#apr.644.3
n,You can't even cite the studies you claim exist,#apr.644.4
n,because they don't exist.#apr.644.5
u,The only mean spirited people are those like yourself, who want to trample the rights of the majority for a non-existent risk that affects a very small number of people.#apr.644.6
u,This has nothing to do with the founding of the U.S. at all.#apr.644.7
n,Air is not recirculated on airplanes.#apr.647.0
u,That's a myth that you need to stop clinging to in order to rationalize your desire for a ban on nuts.#apr.647.1
u,It's a tired, old excuse, but it doesn't work.#apr.647.2
n,So JetBlue serves chips.#apr.647.3
u,Whichever it is, people are allergic to both, so that means you can't serve that as a snack to some people, too.#apr.647.4
u,And down the slippery slope we go.#apr.647.5
u,Good luck with that.#apr.647.6
u,This is not a matter of itchy eyes or a runny nose.#apr.655.0
u,This is a matter of the airway closing down , or the entire body going into anaphylactic shock.#apr.655.1
n,It causes death.#apr.655.2
e,I have such an allergy, but to chewing gum and rubber.#apr.655.3
u,I almost died twice.#apr.655.4
u,For this reason, I can never use any form of public transportation.#apr.655.5
u,The proper way to do this is to ban a substance from the conveyance only if a passenger on that conveyance has a life-threatening allergy to it.#apr.655.6
u,There in lies the problem.#apr.675.0
u,Minors and elderly that can not take care of themselves should not fly alone.#apr.675.1
u,Airlines are not babysitters.#apr.675.2
u,I have always considered that to be negligence on the parents.#apr.675.3
u,Sending your minor child on a plane  across the country, or across the world alone, who knows what could happen.#apr.675.4
u,These are the same "parents" that drive up and drop their child off at a mall for the day, then wonder why they get a call from the police that their child was found dead in a ditch.#apr.675.5
u,You left your minor child unattended.#apr.675.6
u,take responsibility for yourself and your children.#apr.675.7
u,be a REAL parent.#apr.675.8
u,That's the problem with regulations like this.#apr.690.0
n,There are so many reasons why a flight might be delayed#apr.690.1
u,and each of them has a great variance in how long it may take to resolve that issuing a blanket rule would cause as many problems as it solves.#apr.690.2
u,I have no problem with airlines developing their own policies vice a mandated government requirement#apr.694.0
u,but whatever those policies are they need to be easy to find, easy to read and understandable by your "average" person before someone books and pays for a flight.#apr.694.1
u,If you want to regulate this then insist that all policies related to overbooking, rebooking, rerouting, basically any changes to the originally contracted flight must be made available in a format that is easily accessible and understandable to the general public.#apr.694.2
u,This is exactly my point regarding emotional reasoning and also the idea that one individuals comfort is more important than anothers.#apr.731.0
u,in your zeal to ridicule you may have missed the point of alternatives and discussion which I thought was why we were here.#apr.731.1
u,perhaps I was wrong to thing that was what we were suppossed to be doing.#apr.731.2
u,Also, you assume the child will scream.#apr.731.3
u,I would say that perhaps you should help the child become accustomed to the mask before hand by making it a game.#apr.731.4
u,This has worked with other things that children must endure.#apr.731.5
u,Secondly you reject the notion outright and my guess is that you have never tried it.#apr.731.6
u,This also proves that your concern is more with what you want and not what might work.#apr.731.7
u,your reasoning backs us "the collective us" into a corner of take it or leave it.#apr.731.8
u,I am sorry that offering other ideas instead of your preferred ban on peanuts upsets you.#apr.731.9
u,I refer you again to emotional reasoning on that.#apr.731.10
u,dwein003 - The problem is when I pull out a Clif Bar to eat as a snack, or a PBJ sandwich I made at home, or a turkey sandwich on oatnut bread, or a snickers bar...#apr.734.0
u,This is where the holes in the plan becomes apparent.#apr.734.1
u,Eliminating bags of peanuts is not the issue - that's easy.#apr.734.2
u,Because to truly eliminate any potential for airborne peanut , passengers would not be able to bring any food on-board,#apr.734.3
n,because even home-made sandwiches could contain nuts.#apr.734.4
u,And personally, I don't think you can go that far.#apr.734.5
u,And so far on this comment board, no one has been able to address that issue.#apr.734.6
u,A blanket restriction can be communicated as part of the ticket purchase, much like the new luggage fees.#apr.735.0
u,I would suggest asking airlines to print it on the itinerary with food information, and on boarding passes.#apr.735.1
u,As I think about it, there are some serious communication issues with peanut-free zones or individual peanut-free flights.#apr.735.2
e,I have had flight times changed and the airline failed to email or telephone me.#apr.735.3
e,I caught the time change when I logged in to print a boarding pass.#apr.735.4
e,My brother almost missed a flight when the same thing happened to him.#apr.735.5
u,If a peanut-allergic person books a flight a short time before travel, the airlines are not reliable enough to notify passengers.#apr.735.6
n,The information could be provided when people log in to print boarding passes,#apr.735.7
u,but not everyone prints them in advance.#apr.735.8
u,The scenario where a celiac like me packs peanut-containing food and doesn't find out about a peanut restriction until they arrive at the airport is troublesome.#apr.735.9
n,Not all terminals have places where I can buy gluten-free food.#apr.735.10
u,Peanut-free zones on full flights could be handled by the flight staff moving people who want to eat peanuts around the cabin;#apr.735.11
u,however, people are sometimes resistant to being reseated and it puts a burden on the flight crew.#apr.735.12
u,As I write this, I think DOT is going to have to go with an all or none policy on peanuts.#apr.735.13
u,It's too difficult to communicate to other passengers with different dietary restrictions who might pack peanuts with a "sometimes" policy.#apr.735.14
u,Yes, there should be a uniform federal time limit on tarmac delay.#apr.746.0
u,This should apply to all planes that take off or land from US airports: all US flights, foreign flights, and even "flyover" planes that make an emergency landing.#apr.746.1
u,It should apply even to flights of fewer than 30 passengers.#apr.746.2
u,To me, having contingency plans is not as important as a strong penalty for delaying passengers;#apr.746.3
u,I think that is enough of an incentive or deterrent.#apr.746.4
u,I strongly support plans that would allow delayed international passengers to deplane when the delay is sufficiently long.#apr.746.5
e,My husband and I have always been big air travelers.#apr.750.0
e,3 yrs ago we found out that my son  had a peanut allergy.#apr.750.1
u,After blood tests confirmed the allergy, we took steps to make air travel "safer".#apr.750.2
u,Some flights were still taken without many problems#apr.750.3
e,while others were the cause of us no longer flying together as a family or taking cross country trips.#apr.750.4
n,Another commenter mentioned how SWA gave them a "peanut free" flight after they told people they had an allergy.#apr.750.5
u,While this is a nice idea,#apr.750.6
u,it's not really possible.#apr.750.7
n,Even if peanuts aren't served on that flight, they have been served on that plane already.#apr.750.8
u,After telling 3 different people that our child was SEVERELY allergic, the ground 'near' us had peanuts all over it and sent my son into an asthmatic reaction.#apr.750.9
e,Thankfully he did not at the time go into full anaphylactic shock,#apr.750.10
e,but since then his IGA levels in his blood have continued to go up.#apr.750.11
u,This means it is very likely that he would have a more severe reaction to exposure the next time.#apr.750.12
e,We stopped flying about a year and a half ago.#apr.750.13
u,I think it is reasonable to say that if the food you are eating in an enclosed space with recycled air is going to kill a child, you can fore-go eating it for a few hours.#apr.750.14
u,And as for the argument of "perfume" being comparable, which if actually researched is very  different, I do fore-go wearing perfumes on flights as well for that reason.#apr.750.15
u,Not a big deal to skip on it so the person near  me can breath.#apr.750.16
u,I just want to be able to take my family on airplanes without fearing for my child's life.#apr.750.17
u,I appreciate that this is being considered and taken so seriously by the DOT!#apr.750.18
u,Mr. Aldrich:  Please read the earlier posts on this topic.#apr.758.0
u,One would hope that you are a reasonable enough individual that if someone came to you and said that "Eating peanuts next to me could make me really sick - please don't do that" that you would not choose to 'resist' this person.#apr.758.1
n,This is a matter of life and death to some people,#apr.758.2
u,so I would hope that, if faced with a situation, you would show others that you can be a considerate person .#apr.758.3
e,On a plane 2 years ago, when my son was 3, he came into contact the carpeting below the seat and developed hives.#apr.759.0
e,We looked and saw an old peanut under the seat in front of us.#apr.759.1
e,He has a documented peanut allergy.#apr.759.2
n,I suspect that there was residual peanut in the carpet that he came into contact with.#apr.759.3
e,I am fairly certain that this 3 year-old boy he did not get hives because he was 'stressed out'.#apr.759.4
n,Fortunately all he got was hives,#apr.759.5
u,but as best we could tell he did not have a serious ingestion#apr.759.6
e,and our leg of the flight was peanut-free after we had notified the airline of his allergy at booking and check-in.#apr.759.7
u,Please also see posts above citing the peer reviewed medical literature regarding the prevalence of food allergies, and specifically peanut allergies, in children.#apr.759.8
n,So, while it is possible to have an IgE-mediated reaction solely from emotional stress,#apr.759.9
u,this was not the case here.#apr.759.10
u,My family would very much welcome an outright ban on airlines serving peanuts and peanut products.#apr.761.0
e,Our 3-year old daughter experiences anaphylactic reactions to several foods, including peanuts.#apr.761.1
e,Peanuts are the only one of her food allergies that seems to elicit a response, even if she has not ingested or touched it.#apr.761.2
e,For example, she's had reactions after coming in close contact with boxed peanut cookies at the grocery store and when playing in the front yard with some neighbor's kids.#apr.761.3
e,During these episodes, we've been able to give her an antihistamine, her inhaler,#apr.761.4
u,and if required, we'll follow this with a trip to the ER where they administer a steroid.#apr.761.5
e,We stopped flying#apr.761.6
u,because there is not such a third option.#apr.761.7
e,One set of grandparents, aunt, uncle and cousins live on the opposite coast#apr.761.8
e,and we have stopped traveling to visit them.#apr.761.9
e,Since our daughter was diagnosed with this peanut allergy,#apr.761.10
u,We can still control much of her environment to ensure her physical safety#apr.761.11
n,but being on an airplane with peanuts is beyond our control.#apr.761.12
u,we have chosen not to endanger her life.#apr.767.0
e,We recently flew with our 9 year old peanut allergic child.#apr.767.1
e,We notified the airline in advance as we have for every other flight.#apr.767.2
u,I do travel prepared for emergencies, knowing that an epi pen will only work for a short period but carrying it nontheless.#apr.767.3
n,The airline we were on, Delta, announced early in 2010 that they would NO longer be serving peanuts,#apr.767.4
u,which is why we chose this airline.#apr.767.5
e,First flight, no problem, serving pretzels or cookies.#apr.767.6
u,Return flight, as the attendants were approaching our aisle, I thought I was smelling peanuts.#apr.767.7
e,I asked#apr.767.8
e,and Yes indeedy, they were serving peanuts.#apr.767.9
e,Ddn't know she was onboard,#apr.767.10
u,and Gee they're sorry#apr.767.11
n,but they haven't actually implemnted the policy they advertised of no peanuts.#apr.767.12
u,They quickly gave us a 3 aisle buffer zone,#apr.767.13
u,Always nice to have people make angry comments aimed at a CHILD.#apr.767.14
u,which totally made the other passengers angry#apr.767.15
u,as they wanted the same peanuts the other passengers a row or two ahead of them had gotten.#apr.767.16
u,Yes my daughter felt terrible and was very embarrassed,#apr.767.17
u,and I was angry that she had put in a situation that embarrassed her#apr.767.18
u,and, more importantly, I was angry that her health was in danger.#apr.767.19
u,The buffer zones, even when implemented in advance of food service simply can not work.#apr.767.20
n,Peanuts have oil#apr.767.21
n,and that oil gets on the hands of every single person eating them.#apr.767.22
n,The oil is then transferred onto every single surface of the airplane,#apr.767.23
n,and we all know that no cursory cleaning will take care of it.#apr.767.24
n,Even if she is in a "clean zone", the previous 1000 flights have so contaminated the plane that it is not safe for her.#apr.767.25
n,And the bathrooms, armrests, overhead bins, you name it.#apr.767.26
n,ANY surface that is touched by a peanut eating person is deadly to my daughter.#apr.767.27
e,Fortunately for us, she does not have  a severe airborne allergy,#apr.767.28
u,or the smell of the forward cabin's 100 passenger's munching on peanuts would have killed her!#apr.767.29
u,Being asked to forgo peanut snacks for one flight, one snack, one meal is not a big deal for people when the cost of that snack could be a life.#apr.767.30
u,This seems like a no brainer!#apr.767.31
e,We boarded a plane toward the end of the boarding call#apr.770.0
e,because our plane from Florida that connected was late.#apr.770.1
u,We were running and planning to use the bathroom on the plane#apr.770.2
e,cause we didn't have time to stop.#apr.770.3
e,We were not told that the 1 bathroom on the plane was not working.#apr.770.4
u,I had to sit on that plane from AZ to CA and almost wet the seat.#apr.770.5
u,A plane should be required to have working facilities or ground it.#apr.770.6
u,I also think it is just as bad to be stuck on tarmac in small plane as large.#apr.770.7
n,There is no air#apr.770.8
u,and I have anxiety and start feeling really hot if there is no air conditioning and have to wait with all the people breathing in there it gets worse and worse.#apr.770.9
u,2 hours maximum on the tarmac is enough.#apr.770.10
u,Deboard plane and let people get off.#apr.770.11
u,We are not cattle or sheep to be herded up in a pen .#apr.770.12
u,It is inhuman.#apr.770.13
u,My son is severely allergic to peanuts and has allergic reactions as a result of being around people eating peanuts due to the peanut dust in the air.#apr.776.0
e,We had to travel internationally and were able to work with the airline to book peanut free roundtrip flights after submitting a letter from my son's allergist.#apr.776.1
e,The airline did everything they could including serving snacks without peanuts, putting allergy alert stickers on our seats, and making an announcement asking passengers to refrain from eating their peanut snacks.#apr.776.2
e,My son was fine going to our destination but had an allergic reaction within minutes of being seated for our return trip.#apr.776.3
e,Since he didn't eat any peanuts,#apr.776.4
e,we gave him some benadryl, moved him to a different row, and wiped down his new seat.#apr.776.5
u,We were fortunate that his reaction was not severe enough to require an epi-pen injection and a trip to the hospital in another country.#apr.776.6
e,We suspect that he was reacting to peanut residue in the area of his seat from the previous flight.#apr.776.7
u,We may not be so lucky next time#apr.776.8
n,because we have been told that the next reaction is even stronger than the last.#apr.776.9
e,Even though we were on a peanut-free fight,#apr.776.10
u,my son still was not safe because of the peanut residue on the plane from a previous flight.#apr.776.11
u,If peanuts are banned on all flights, my son would have been safe.#apr.776.12
n,When an allergic reaction occurs high up in the sky over a huge ocean, and an epi-pen injection can only give a person an extra 20 minutes, there is not enough time to turn the plane around and take the person to the hospital.#apr.776.13
u,I believe that it is reasonable to ban peanuts from airline flights if that assures the safety of a passenger that has a severe peanut allergy.#apr.776.14
n,This decision could mean life or death for someone.#apr.776.15
u,Thank you for your thoughtful consideration to ban peanuts from flights.#apr.776.16
u,With all of the other travel sites  out there, I would imagine that if there was such a high demand for people to see full prices with bags and other fees, these sites would have created something to compensate for it.#apr.780.0
u,They would offer some sort of system where you could maybe "check off" boxes for what you want included, along with the options like dates or times, prefer nonstop, flexibility, etc.#apr.780.1
u,These sites would then offer the lowest fare based on your preferences per airline.#apr.780.2
n,However, since these sites aren't providing those options,#apr.780.3
n,There is no scientific evidence showing that peanut allergies are increasing.#apr.795.0
u,Self-reporting studies are inherently flawed and cannot be used for that very purpose.#apr.795.1
u,Uninformed parents think every adverse reaction to some food must be an allergy,#apr.795.2
u,and they don't bother to have their children tested to find out.#apr.795.3
u,Without there being a unified standard for allergy testing and diagnosis, any studies will be irrelevant and nothing more than a source of debate among the scientific community.#apr.795.4
u,I certainly won't ante up my peanut allergic child as sacrificial proof that banning peanuts on flights is a simpler solution than emergency landings and potential funerals.#apr.802.0
u,Occam's razor - the simplest solution is usually the correct or most effective one.#apr.802.1
u,There are two main factions here: those who believe that it is right to help the few to live life to the fullest of their abilities, and those who believe that no-one has the right to pass laws they do not agree with .#apr.805.0
u,And it is very obvious that a consensus will not be agreed upon here.#apr.805.1
u,No doubt the peanut lobby played a major part in that directive.#apr.805.2
u,Those who have legitimate life threatening allergies  have a right to be heard.#apr.805.3
u,Unfortunately, there appear to be many who wish to snuff out these voices because certain rights may be impeded.#apr.805.4
u,Congress should listen to the doctors and scientists who study these disabilities and allow the experts to make their honest recommendations.#apr.805.5
u,I understand that the peanut lobby will probably want their say,#apr.805.6
u,but money should not outweigh logic and science.#apr.805.7
u,I would prefer a total ban on peanut and tree nut foods being served on flights.#apr.805.8
e,My granddaughter has been medically diagnosed as having several allergies, including these two items.#apr.805.9
u,We are not hysterical,#apr.805.10
u,and we would be much happier if these allergies could disappear or be cured.#apr.805.11
u,Unfortunately, the science is not there yet.#apr.805.12
u,So, the family must all read labels, call companies when the labels are not clear, talk with restaurants, take "safe" food with us when no other solution is possible, and always carry a bag with any possibly required medications.#apr.805.13
u,We accept these as our responsibility.#apr.805.14
u,We are restricted from being able to take family vacations very far from home because of the negative attitudes of the airline companies, or lack of choices because of living next to a Delta hub.#apr.805.15
u,This does not affect one person, this affects 12!#apr.805.16
u,I would have thought that the airlines would have taken this into account when looking at their bottom dollar,#apr.805.17
u,but Delta has stated that they will not restrict peanuts because their home is in Georgia!#apr.805.18
u,The negative comments from some of the writers posted here are not helpful in defining what is the correct solution to allow allergy sufferers, and their families, to fly.#apr.805.19
u,Get the feedback from the experts, make logical decisions, and fund the research into finding cures or relief for those suffering from the disability of life threatening allergies.#apr.805.20
u,All life threatening allergies!#apr.805.21
u,But please do not wait until someone dies before acting.#apr.805.22
n,There are several institutions researching peanut allergies.#apr.807.0
n,Duke University Medical Center, National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, and The Johns Hopkins University Medical Center all have prominent, reputable, knowledgeable experts in this field studying this problem.#apr.807.1
u,I doubt any immunologist or allergy specialist will provide a universal radius for the DOT to establish a peanut-free zone on an aircraft.#apr.807.2
n,A single person can have varied reactions from being exposed to the same amount of the same allergen on different days.#apr.807.3
u,Now factor in every other peanut allergy sufferer in the country and you have yourself a multivariate problem of the grandest magnitude.#apr.807.4
u,With this many variables to solve for, the simplest and most effective solution is a buffer radius of infinity .#apr.807.5
u,I realize this scientific data is the key to removing the Congressionally-imposed funding restrictions,#apr.807.6
u,but it seems like common sense should prevail on issues of passenger safety and the study should simply be a formality.#apr.807.7
u,Removing peanuts and peanut products from aircraft will significantly reduce the probability of an anaphylactic reaction in-flight the same way routine aircraft maintenance significantly reduces the probability of aircraft failures.#apr.807.8
u,Regarding peanut free flights, Southwest Airlines has been the most accommodating in our experience.#apr.807.9
u,With enough advance notification, they will withhold serving peanuts on our flight and provide an alternative snack for the passengers.#apr.807.10
u,We try to take the first flight of the day to minimize peanut residue and crumbs that are found with greater frequency as the day wears on.#apr.807.11
e,We also wipe our entire row of seats, tray tables, seat belts and the seat back in front of us with baby wipes when we board.#apr.807.12
u,With this self-imposed protocol in place, my 4-year old daughter has avoided severe reactions from exposure to a peanut allergen on an aircraft,#apr.807.13
e,although she does spend most of the flight sneezing, scratching, and rubbing her eyes while we're on the edge of our seat looking for signs of a stronger reaction.#apr.807.14
n,There is not a person on this planet that will die because they did not receive a peanut snack on their flight.#apr.807.15
n,There are millions of people  who could die due to some form of exposure to a peanut allergen on their flight.#apr.807.16
u,This is a no-brainer...#apr.807.17
u,take the darn peanuts off of the planse.#apr.807.18
u,I have a similar problem with errors on your website with MacOS Safari before it is published.#apr.825.0
u,Once the plane has left the gate as long as it's officially waiting for take-off, then it appears to me passengers should not be allowed to leave the gate.#apr.826.0
e,However, I remember times while traveling thru Denver, United would leave the gate, then taxi to the "penalty box" waiting for clearances and take off instructions.#apr.826.1
u,Airlines should not be allowed to leave the gate unless there is a expected takeoff time issued by FAA ATC Clearance Delivery and Ground Control.#apr.826.2
u,If the expected departure time issued by FAA ATC is over 3 hours then the aircraft should not be allowed to leave the gate.#apr.826.3
u,However, if an airline has left the gate, and the departure time is extended while waiting for take-off,  where the total time is greater than three hours on the ground then the airport and airline should get buses out to the aircraft for any passengers that want to deplane.#apr.826.4
u,As you can see there are mitigating circumstances affecting the airline and aircraft#apr.826.5
n,and there are a few organizations involved in the situation..#apr.826.6
n,these organizations include the airport authority, the FAA ATC ground control and clearance delivery control, and airline pilots.#apr.826.7
u,Too often fees are hidden until payment is made.#apr.831.0
n,And options are not offered to delete those fees.#apr.831.1
u,ALL fees should be disclosed upfront, in all advertising, and on all websites!  No exceptions!#apr.831.2
u,Unbundled fares doesn't give airlines the right to deceptively advertise costs.#apr.832.0
u,ALL costs should be disclosed in an a la carte menu upfront!#apr.832.1
u,Airlines need to have a standard on oversize baggage.#apr.854.0
u,That price should be prominently listed and easily accessible so the consumer can discern the total price of flying with oversized baggage.#apr.854.1
u,Oversized baggage charges should be based on a standard measuring system as opposed to contents;#apr.854.2
u,for example surfboards can be charged twice as much as golf clubs.#apr.854.3
u,You raise a point which underscores the reasons why such bans are inappropriate.#apr.858.0
u,People who have such conditions  have the ultimate responsibility to themselves to determine risks to their unusual sensitivities,#apr.858.1
u,and to be prepared to deal with the consequences of exposure should they decide to accept those risks.#apr.858.2
u,Your "disability" does not give you the right to infringe indiscriminately upon others.#apr.858.3
u,Too often people seem to think they are "special" and deserve more consideration and privilege than the "normal" masses.#apr.858.4
u,Your rights end where mine begin.#apr.858.5
u,You do not have the right to keep me off a flight because I have a cat and its dander may be on my clothing, due to your rare sensitivity.#apr.858.6
u,You should make whatever travel arrangements are necessary to accommodate your unusual needs.#apr.858.7
u,You do not have the right to keep me off a flight because I had peanuts for lunch and their dust may be on my clothing, because you have a rare allergy.#apr.858.8
u,You should make whatever travel arrangements are necessary to accommodate your unusual needs.#apr.858.9
u,If we start down this road eventually we will all have to fly naked, freshly showered, and hungry.#apr.858.10
u,Give me a break.#apr.858.11
u,Your needs are YOUR responsibility.#apr.858.12
u,The DOT should allow airlines to voluntarily accommodate if they so choose , but not require any bans.#apr.858.13
u,You realize, though, that this is a risk that you take when you travel in an airplane.#apr.881.0
u,There are risks associated with every type of travel,#apr.881.1
u,and lost or delayed luggage is a risk associated with flying.#apr.881.2
u,While it's extremely inconvenient to be without luggage,#apr.881.3
u,it would be unrealistic to expect that luggage will always be on time,#apr.881.4
u,just as it would be unrealistic to expect always to avoid the risk of traffic when deciding to drive.#apr.881.5
n,When you choose to fly, you also choose to adopt the risks of flying, from loss of life to loss of luggage.#apr.881.6
n,Speaking of UPS, they are now offering a new service to customers:#apr.881.7
n,they will ship your luggage,#apr.881.8
n,so you can mail it ahead of time or avoid the risk of losing your luggage in transit.#apr.881.9
u,I think it's interesting that solutions to this problem are coming from outside of the airlines themselves.#apr.881.10
n,Here's a link to that story:#apr.881.11
n,Actually, there are over 50 US air carriers to choose from,#apr.882.0
u,so although the airline industry is not perfectly competitive,#apr.882.1
u,it certainly is not monopolistic.#apr.882.2
n,Since the end of the CAB  air travel has become much more competitive and fares have dropped dramatically.#apr.882.3
n,According to the GAO, fares fell by 30%  between 1976 and 1990 because of deregulation, and have fallen another 25% since 1991.#apr.882.4
n,Here's an interesting article about the lower costs and greater availability of air travel due to airline deregulation:#apr.882.5
n,the DOT got the idea of flight notifications from the airlines themselves,#apr.883.0
u,so I wouldn't be so quick to discount the incentive that customer satisfaction plays to airlines.#apr.883.1
n,Here is an excerpt from the proposed rule:#apr.883.2
u,Any business which intends to survive has to satisfy its customers,#apr.883.3
u,otherwise the customers will simply stop buying their product,#apr.883.4
u,and the business will go bankrupt.#apr.883.5
n,Airlines themselves already thought up flight status notifications#apr.883.6
n,because there was customer demand for them.#apr.883.7
u,I find it interesting that you claim neither passengers nor profits to be benefiting from the current state of air transit affairs.#apr.883.8
u,Now, air fare is affordable  and more available to citizens than ever before.#apr.883.9
u,Airlines like Southwest are benefiting#apr.883.10
u,exactly because they are offering low fares, serving their customer needs,#apr.883.11
u,which would seem to disprove your statement that both profits and passengers suffer in the status quo.#apr.883.12
u,Here is an incentive:#apr.885.0
u,if a customer is dissatisfied with flight notifications, they ought to take their business elsewhere.#apr.885.1
n,No one dies  of a lack of peanuts#apr.899.0
n,but people can and do die of peanut allergies.#apr.899.1
e,I live in Hawaii where a 6 hour flight is required to go anywhere.#apr.899.2
e,My granddaughter's peanut allergy was discovered from a kiss from her mother that had eaten a peanut butter sandwich.#apr.899.3
u,Mom didn't have any obvious peanut butter on her.#apr.899.4
n,People eating peanuts and touching the bathroom or left on the seats could cause a reaction at 30,000 feet.#apr.899.5
n,Epipens buy you 15 minutes.#apr.899.6
n,The Doctor says we can do that twice.#apr.899.7
n,That won't save her if she is out over the ocean.#apr.899.8
u,Please ban peanuts altogether.#apr.899.9
u,Airlines should require a gate agent to give hourly status or tell passengers when to return to the gate for status.#apr.906.0
e,I endured an all-day wait without being advised of status.#apr.906.1
e,We were scheduled for an 8am departure.#apr.906.2
e,Gate personnel advised us of mechanical problems and said to check back at 10am.#apr.906.3
e,At 9am, a gate agent advised maybe a 11am boarding#apr.906.4
e,people who did not arrive till 10am per prior instruction never heard that announcement.#apr.906.5
e,After that NO ONE gave us status.#apr.906.6
e,It was 6pm before we found out the flight was canceled by calling the airlines.#apr.906.7
e,The notice on the departure boards and at the gate said "delayed"...#apr.906.8
e,a gate agent never gave us status after 9am!#apr.906.9
e,A fellow passenger happened to work at this airline,#apr.906.10
e,so he made some calls and was able to get status from the maintenance crew...#apr.906.11
e,the maintenance chief said his estimated time of fix was 5PM - maybe.#apr.906.12
u,If some "official" from the airline had done the same thing, the passengers could have done something else for those many hours rather than hang around the airport, checking the departures board for status.#apr.906.13
e,Also no compensation given...#apr.906.14
u,but that's another discussion.#apr.906.15
u,No, it would not have changed the delay or cancellation situation,#apr.906.16
n,but if an agent had said check back in x number of hours, then actually come to the gate at that time, people could have done something else.#apr.906.17
e,I've worked in customer service before.#apr.906.18
u,Customers want to know what's happening if only to be told "this is the problem, we're still working on it..."#apr.906.19
u,I agree with the proposed solutions.#apr.908.0
u,Let's keep in mind that a bumped passenger may miss a cruise ship departure, miss a connecting flight, lose a day  of a prepaid vacation, or miss a wedding or funeral#apr.914.0
u,because the airline was greedy and didn't want even one empty seat on their flight.#apr.914.1
u,If being bumped from a flight caused additional problems for the bumped passenger then the passenger should be able to submit proof of loss and the airline should have to compensate WITHOUT LIMIT in addition to the proposed penalties.#apr.914.2
u,I also like the idea of pre notification of bumping.#apr.914.3
n,It can cost well over $100 to get to an airport#apr.914.4
n,for example, central NJ to JFK is about $150#apr.914.5
n,and for a long vacation this is cheaper than airport parking.#apr.914.6
n,When a passenger is bumped and the next available flight is the next day this can mean an additional $300and in travel costs.#apr.914.7
u,Most airlines have forgotten that the customer is there for their sake, not the other way around,#apr.919.0
u,hence service plans should be explicit and fair.#apr.919.1
u,Follow the golden rule, treat passenger the same way you, the airline, would like to treated.#apr.919.2
e,I am highly allergic to cats, and somewhat allergic to dogs.#apr.922.0
e,I have stopped flying since pets have been allowed in the cabin.#apr.922.1
e,I was part of a Johns Hopkins cat allergy study#apr.922.2
e,because I have severe asthma attacks in the presence of cats.#apr.922.3
e,They tested me by putting me in a room with caged cats.#apr.922.4
e,I am able to be in the presence of a cat owner#apr.922.5
e,because they don't usually jump around spreading dander from their clothing.#apr.922.6
e,I just have to refrain from hugging them.#apr.922.7
u,I'm not likely to hug a fellow passenger.#apr.922.8
e,I made the mistake of sitting in a front seat on a SW flight to California from Maryland, last November.#apr.922.9
e,I went through 2 bags of cough drops#apr.922.10
e,because the tickle in my throat would not stop.#apr.922.11
u,Once I left the plane, the irritation ceased.#apr.922.12
e,I saw on my return flight that a service dog was sitting in the seat I had been in on the way out.#apr.922.13
e,That must be why I reacted.#apr.922.14
e,I then sat in a seat farther back.#apr.922.15
u,That would work out if service dogs were all that was allowed.#apr.922.16
n,The fact that dogs and cats are now allowed and may be anywhere in the cabin, makes it possibly deadly for me.#apr.922.17
n,I cannot leave the plane at 30,000 feet in the air.#apr.922.18
u,I usually take my inhaler and leave the area of contamination.#apr.922.19
e,I was on those flights#apr.922.20
u,because I did not realize there had been a change in SW policy.#apr.922.21
e,I was in line to board the plane#apr.922.22
u,before I realized there had been a change.#apr.922.23
e,The return trip was also booked and paid for.#apr.922.24
u,I do not know why people are upset about pets not being allowed in the cabin.#apr.922.25
n,It's just been recently that this has been allowed.#apr.922.26
e,I now travel cross country by car and call ahead to be sure that the hotel room does not allow pets.#apr.922.27
n,That's getting harder to find now, too.#apr.922.28
u,The peanut allergy people are even in a worse position than I am.#apr.922.29
u,Their sensitivity is even more acute.#apr.922.30
u,I fail to understand why so many people are so selfish that they cannot give up peanuts for a few hours.#apr.922.31
n,I understand that they do air condition those compartments when pets are in them.#apr.922.32
u,Making sure those compartments are comfortable is a good solution.#apr.922.33
n,For those who require a protein snack. I remember SW used to give snacks that had little sausages and cheese packets in them.#apr.922.34
n,I know that even lactose intolerant people would be able to eat the sausage and maybe even the cheese .#apr.922.35
n,I know that people allergic to dairy do not react to touching something a cheese eater has touched.#apr.922.36
n,They must consume the product.#apr.922.37
n,It is documented that there are a large number of people allergic to cats and dogs and a pretty good number of people allergic to peanuts.#apr.922.38
u,I do not think that fear of red hair is a documented problem large enough to be considered.#apr.922.39
e,I noticed perfume was also mentioned.#apr.922.40
u,My husband and I are also sensitive to perfumes#apr.922.41
u,but we haven't really had a problem with overly scented passengers.#apr.922.42
n,We already are limited in what we can bring in our carryons.#apr.922.43
u,I think those are the major problems for allergies.#apr.922.44
u,Maybe just looking at peanut allergies is too narrow.#apr.922.45
n,Canada's lung association is currently fighting the concept of pets being allowed in Canadian Airline cabins.#apr.922.46
u,I think we need to take a look at what's happening there.#apr.922.47
u,As to the cost and benefit analysis projections prepared by DOT, it would seem to be the shorter the tarmac delay time, analogous to a ship idled in port, the likelihood of saving money would be greater with a shorter delay time to return to the gate.#apr.923.0
u,This would seem to make the greater economic sense.#apr.923.1
u,It should be self evident based upon "running" time cost in a queue compared to cost of delay to determine a break even point.#apr.923.2
u,While this approach might cause inconvenience to some passengers,#apr.923.3
u,it become a sum zero game when measured against waiting time on the tarmac, with all the fuss that that generates.#apr.923.4
e,I am 72 years old and have medical problems.#apr.926.0
e,I need to use the toilet often and need to drink lots of water for the medication that I'm on.#apr.926.1
e,Before I board a flight, I take care of these things#apr.926.2
u,so it's not a big deal during a flight.#apr.926.3
u,But if we sit on the tarmac for a long time, I'm in BIG trouble!#apr.926.4
e,I have consistently had the problem where I selected a flight, and clicked the "Select" button, only to be told that the price had suddenly risen by hundreds of dollars.#apr.931.0
u,It's the old "bait and switch".#apr.931.1
e,When I cancel and start over again, I see the same thing: a low-ball offer, with a much higher price when I try to buy the ticket.#apr.931.2
u,Airlines  should be required to honor the offered price for at least some number of minutes - at least 10 minutes.#apr.931.3
u,If the flight sells out while I'm deciding then fine,#apr.931.4
u,but the price I get should be the price I'm offered - if there is a seat still available.#apr.931.5
u,No bait and switch while you're online.#apr.931.6
n,All the talk about baggage has been focusing on the fees and on what problems flight attendants claim it causes because more people are carrying on more.#apr.964.0
n,These baggage issues came up during the House Transportation Committee's hearing last week.#apr.964.1
u,While I don't like the baggage fees,#apr.964.2
u,as a fairly frequent traveler for business, the main reason I do not check my luggage has nothing to do with baggage fees.#apr.964.3
e,I do not check my luggage because of all the time it takes.#apr.964.4
u,When you travel regularly, adding an extra hour plus to each direction of each trip is alot of time that can be much better spent elsewhere and on other things.#apr.964.5
n,The baggage handling process at some airports is incredibly slow#apr.964.6
e,and sometimes I could be home or at my hotel in the time it takes me to get my bag at the baggage claim.#apr.964.7
u,The  baggage handling process is too slow and inefficient for many frequent business travelers to use.#apr.964.8
u,A note on fees - the idea of charging extra for both checked and carry-on luggage as an "extra" or optional service that can be unbundled is ridiculous.#apr.964.9
n,Virtually no one can travel without either a checked bag or a carry-on.#apr.964.10
u,Even business people who travel somewhere in the morning and back the same night tend to bring a briefcase or similar.#apr.964.11
u,If virtually everyone would have to pay the fee, then it is not optional and should be part of the ticket price.#apr.964.12
u,The rules should be standard#apr.969.0
u,and they should be specific#apr.969.1
u,and they should apply to all commercial airlines in American air space#apr.969.2
u,and there should be significant and mandatory fines imposed for violation of the rules just like there are for aircraft safety .#apr.969.3
u,If the rule is not specific and does not apply to all the airlines will find ways to avoid it.#apr.969.4
u,The additional standards mentioned should be included.#apr.969.5
u,I urge strong consideration of a complete ban on peanuts during all domestic flights.#apr.979.0
e,Due to severe peanut allergy, I can now only fly on flights that ban peanuts completely.#apr.979.1
e,I live in Minnesota#apr.979.2
n,where Delta recently purchased Northwest Airlines#apr.979.3
n,Northwest was peanut-free.#apr.979.4
n,A peanut-free buffer zone is not sufficient protection from air that is circulated throughout a plane's cabin.#apr.979.5
n,Nor does such a zone protect from peanut residue left behind from previous flights.#apr.979.6
u,It seems illogical to serve a highly allergy-inducing product on airliners at 30,000 feet when unlimited other snack options exist.#apr.979.7
n,I can only surmise that a strong lobby effort and financial incentives have kept peanuts on airplanes, to the peril of allergic individuals  and the liability of the carriers.#apr.979.8
u,All travel websites along with the airline websites need to be held accountable to these rules.#apr.981.0
u,Leg room needs to be standardized throughout the industry.#apr.981.1
u,Then a consumer can make a more informed choice of whether or not to pay extra for additional leg room.#apr.981.2
u,I recommend the industry adopt a 33" pitch throughout economy seating.#apr.981.3
u,Increased fees after a ticket has been purchased is nothing short of "bait and switch"#apr.981.4
n,which I believe the federal government has declared illegal and prosecutable when businesses attempt to engage in such practices.#apr.981.5
u,Airlines need to be held to account like any other business entity.#apr.981.6
u,I do not see why airlines should be immune to this by DOT's proposals.#apr.981.7
u,If all fees and taxes, actual cost of ticket, opt-in extras for baggage and additional leg room would certainly aid me in comparing prices between airlines and allow me a more informed choice.#apr.981.8
u,My main problem is with the form of compensation.#apr.997.0
u,The last thing I want is a voucher, with numerous restrictions and an expiration date, from an airline I may never want to fly with again.#apr.997.1
e,I have received several of these over the years and have never used any of them.#apr.997.2
u,The DOT should require that debit cards be issued on the spot for the compensatory amount or perhaps an unrestricted voucher that any airline must accept#apr.997.3
u,and let the airlines work out amongst themselves how they will compensate each other.#apr.997.4
u,Although I understand the seriousness of the issue for those with severe reactions#apr.1000.0
u,I think an outright ban would be the only effective way to reduce the danger.#apr.1000.1
u,However, you will not be able to prevent individual travelers from purchasing and transporting their own stash.#apr.1000.2
e,I have been flying internationally and domestically for 59 years#apr.1000.3
e,and never encountered an incidence of an allergic reaction on any flight.#apr.1000.4
u,I feel that any individual with such a severe reaction needs to take the necessary precautions personally and not ask the airline to provide them.#apr.1000.5
n,The information and technology is available#apr.1002.0
u,so I don't find it burdensome for an airline , or for the DOT themselves to accumulate and present the info in a useable fashion for interested travelers.#apr.1002.1
u,I see no issue with baggage fees.#apr.1041.0
u,I have an issue with what RyanAir is doing or trying to do and that is charging for bathroom use.#apr.1041.1
n,Airlines need to make a profit...#apr.1041.2
n,but the whole system is full costs that are not fully realized in ticket prices.#apr.1041.3
u,The government should mandate price waterlines to cover costs#apr.1041.4
u,or the airlines will cut tickets to gain passengers while neglecting their planes and their staff.#apr.1041.5
u,The less strict approach on post-purchase increases seems reasonable.#apr.1066.0
u,Full disclosure on fares will help with purchasing, yes.#apr.1066.1
u,firstly, all airline personnel must act as humans and treat their CUSTOMERS as such.#apr.1076.0
u,TELL US THE PROBLEM;#apr.1076.1
u,DON'T TREAT US LIKE CATTLE;#apr.1076.2
u,FOLLOW THE GOLDEN RULE WHEN THINGS START TO GO WRONG!#apr.1076.3
u,tarmac delay rules should apply to every flight; EVERY FLIGHT!#apr.1076.4
u,the CUSTOMERS who must exit or who need aid should be SERVED regardless of the size of the plane, its origination, or its destination.#apr.1076.5
u,airlines and airports should tell the truth, the whole truth, and treat their CUSTOMERS with respect!#apr.1076.6
u,if unpredictable situations arise, well-informed CUSTOMERS who are treated with respect will, most of the time, respond accordingly.#apr.1076.7
n,as far as i can tell, airlines are not legally liable for anything any more;#apr.1076.8
n,delays, cancellations, etc. are always blamed on the weather now#apr.1076.9
u,and CUSTOMERS, when finally untethered from their seats, are finally freed with an attitude of  "don't let the door hit you on your way out."#apr.1076.10
u,airports and airlines should have contingency plans which clearly separate their responsibilities,#apr.1076.11
u,so that each knows what it must provide when accommodating CUSTOMERS in a crisis.#apr.1076.12
u,yes, international CUSTOMERS should not be subjected to more stress and inconvenience by being kept on the plane any longer than normal flight time.#apr.1076.13
u,this would be very human, and kind, the kind of thing a company should want to provide for its CUSTOMERS.#apr.1076.14
u,as for delays, this depends on the projected duration of delay.#apr.1076.15
u,the three-hour limit should have no bearing.#apr.1076.16
u,if the delay is more than one hour, CUSTOMERS should be allowed off.#apr.1076.17
u,BUT!  it should be made crystal clear to anyone who deplanes that it is his or her responsibility to get back before the plane departs.#apr.1076.18
u,NO IFS ANDS OR BUTS.#apr.1076.19
u,airlines should exert some backbone and make this stick#apr.1076.20
u,and CUSTOMERS will admire and appreciate them for it.#apr.1076.21
u,this will add to the delay,#apr.1076.22
u,as baggage will have to be removed,#apr.1076.23
u,but soon enough the problem will be minimal.#apr.1076.24
u,DOT should prohibit oversales on smaller aircraft unless they can compensate passengers for being bumped.#apr.1078.0
u,Zero fare customers should be compensated.#apr.1078.1
u,jsoodi - You have one major perception in your post,#apr.1095.0
u,Peanut allergy is common,.#apr.1095.1
u,It is NOT common.#apr.1095.2
n,It affects somewhere between .6 and 1.5% of the US population#apr.1095.3
u,and "severe" reactions are far more rare then that.#apr.1095.4
u,Oh well, by all means, lets wait until we have an epidemic of allergy related deaths on planes before we attempt to answer this question.#apr.1110.0
u,I wonder how you would react to someone suffocating to death next to you on an airplane.#apr.1110.1
u,I agree that 3 hours is way too long to be stranded on the tarmac for health, comfort, and emotional reasons.#apr.1118.0
u,I am a bit confused as to why people are not kept at the boarding area longer.#apr.1118.1
u,I find it hard to believe that it is always a last minute surprise that comes after everyone is boarded on the plane.#apr.1118.2
u,I think there should be a time limit on internatioanl flights as well.#apr.1118.3
u,Of course all flights should be covered by the 3-hour limit - that's a no-brainer.#apr.1133.0
u,This is all about the convenience for airlines, with complete disregard for comfort and safety of the passenger.#apr.1133.1
u,Airlines need to be reminded that they are a SERVICE business and should at least attempt to behave as such.#apr.1133.2
u,Based on my own experience, buffer zones are pointless because of the poor job the airlines typically do cleaning planes in between flights.#apr.1153.0
e,I have a peanut-allergic child,#apr.1153.1
u,and even with an announced buffer zone, there are usually peanuts stuck in the seat cushions or lying on the floor from the previous flight.#apr.1153.2
u,Either a particular airplane should be peanut-free or not;#apr.1153.3
u,the intermediate solution isn't much of a solution.#apr.1153.4
u,Of all the many, many things that are unsatisfactory about airline travel,#apr.1169.0
u,and those that are also within the ability of the airline to control , the issue of tarmac delay is the most important to me and far and away the most troubling.#apr.1169.1
u,I cannot imagine why any airline thinks that it is wise commercial practice to hold its "customers" as prisoner in a venue that most of us occupy for only the shortest possible time, commensurate with using the "service" at all.#apr.1169.2
u,The initial rule limiting this practice was the single best thing for travelers that the DOT has done in years,#apr.1169.3
u,and the proposed rule broadening this practice and shortening the period of involuntary imprisonment should be adopted as is, or even strengthened.#apr.1169.4
u,And it makes no difference if these are international or domestic flights, international or domestic airlines, big or small air terminals, etc.#apr.1169.5
u,Prison is prison.#apr.1169.6
u,The obfuscatory practices around the fees are bad enough,#apr.1199.0
u,but, what is also bad is that these fees are typically non-refundable, even if the airline fails to provide the service they are charging for.#apr.1199.1
n,For example, if they mishandle your baggage, they do not refund the fee.#apr.1199.2
u,This rule should include a requirement that fees are refundable for non-performance on the airline's part.#apr.1199.3
u,Also, there should be a minimum level of service defined in the rules ...#apr.1199.4
u,maybe one checked bag and one carryon bag included in the ticket price.#apr.1199.5
u,And, yes, very clear information on fees is an absolute ...#apr.1199.6
u,travelers should not need to be confused or misdirected regarding the bottom line price of a flight.#apr.1199.7
u,Make the compensation based on the value of the flight and remove the caps.#apr.1200.0
u,And, it should also include fare and fees, since, things seem to be going the way of fees being the larger part of the cost of flying.#apr.1200.1
n,Due to the many causes for delays,#apr.1213.0
u,it is important to have guaranteed delay times.#apr.1213.1
n,For example, we are told that there will be an update at 45 minutes past the hour, only to see it move up or back depending on the repair, clearing of weather, arrival of the crew, or other factor.#apr.1213.2
n,If there was a specific time locked in, you could go to another area assured that information would be honored and the flight could proceed on a known schedule.#apr.1213.3
u,If you ban peanuts being served, then you'll have to ban all carry on food.#apr.1217.0
u,Couple that with the ban on bringing on personal water and increasingly invasive body searches and air travel is becoming pretty austere.#apr.1217.1
u,I've been on many flights now that airlines no longer serve food where people bring on all sorts of personal food, including extremely "fragrant" ethnic foods.#apr.1217.2
u,This could easily become a slippery slope, as so much in the govt where we continue to erode personal liberties.#apr.1217.3
e,Sitting next to a smoker with smoke on their clothes or a person with perfume can trigger an asthma attack for me.#apr.1217.4
u,So let's ban smokers who've had a cigarette in 24 hours and all fragrances.#apr.1217.5
u,I have visions of being stripped naked and put in little pods and put to sleep in order to keep everyone "safe" on flights.#apr.1217.6
u,This is not the brave new world I want to live in!#apr.1217.7
u,Rather than set explicit dollar amounts for compensation, just make it equivalent to or twice the cost of the ticket in question.#apr.1240.0
u,That way, the compensation automatically tracks changes in air fares over time.#apr.1240.1
e,It's also worth noting that when I buy bus, train, or ferry tickets I pay up front and own the ticket .#apr.1240.2
n,If I miss the train, I lose.#apr.1240.3
e,Luckily I have never been in this position yet,  For most of my flights are international.#apr.1280.0
u,If the airline asks me to stay behind I will reject,#apr.1280.1
u,there is a reason I set up my flights as I did#apr.1280.2
n,so that I can make my international connections or visit friends at those places before I leave the same day.#apr.1280.3
u,The airlines have no right to bump people, if they over book and everyone shows up they better add an extra seat to the wing or something!#apr.1280.4
u,I think you guys need to make this more clear,#apr.1282.0
u,as I am looking over this I cannot really figure out what it is you want us to comment about..#apr.1282.1
n,We are talking about departing flights so, in theory, the people on the plane have not yet passed through Customs and Immigration since they are not in the new country yet.#apr.1291.0
u,Except for some places where Customs is done at the departing airport .#apr.1291.1
u,So, yes, if it's that big a deal I would support some kind of holding area.#apr.1291.2
u,As a frequent traveler and the mom of a 23 year old with multiple food allergies, I understand how complicated this type of rule making can be.#apr.234.0
u,The "rights" of the peanut allergy sufferer are in direct conflict with the "rights" of the passengers that want to eat peanuts.#apr.234.1
e,For many years we avoided the conflict by traveling throughout the U.S. via motorhome.#apr.234.2
u,This is not a reasonable option for everyone#apr.234.3
u,since it can be very time consuming vs. flying.#apr.234.4
u,Now that my son is older and interested in traveling to Europe,#apr.234.5
u,we can't reasonably get there via motorhome.#apr.234.6
u,We choose our airlines carefully, carry multiple Epi-pens, pack his food from home, and I pray.#apr.234.7
u,It's a very scary propostion being 35,000 feet in the air over the open ocean, knowing that each Epi-pen is effective for approximately 10-15 minutes.#apr.234.8
e,My son tries to sleep most of the flight and fortunately has a much larger bladder than I do.#apr.234.9
e,He gets a window seat and one of us acts as his buffer to the food cart.#apr.234.10
u,This is a scary and risky proposition with a 23 year old who can quickly determine his own symptoms.#apr.234.11
u,It would be even scarier with a young child.#apr.234.12
u,The problem with peanuts and tree nuts is that they are dry and flaky so can readily become airborne.#apr.234.13
n,Their oils are sticky and stubborn so can endure through a vigorous scrub with soap and water.#apr.234.14
e,My son is also allergic to milk and eggs.#apr.234.15
n,Nobody talks about banning them#apr.234.16
n,because they don't have the above mentioned properties of peanuts and tree nuts.#apr.234.17
u,Traveling the world is an envigorating and enlightening experience that many would argue is as important as the structured education that we experience from 12-16and years.#apr.234.18
n,Many people have to travel for work#apr.234.19

u,So let's be reasonable#apr.234.25
u,and let all safely travel.#apr.234.26
u,Ban the nuts#apr.234.27
u,and see how many more families get onboard.#apr.234.28

u,You have to eat once you get there!#apr.234.34
n,FYI the DOT has closed this proposal#apr.712.0
n,as they are not allowed to ban peanuts without further studies.#apr.712.1
u,For more information regarding airborne anaphylaxis  see the below studies published by the National Institute of Health:#apr.712.2
u,It will also be necessary for Servicer's to transfer knowledge concerning any loan modification request in their pipeline.#ms.4.0
u,Also, no penalties should be applied if for some reason the homeowner does not make the payment on time to the new Servicer, within 30 days from the notice of transfer to the new Servicer.#ms.4.1
u,Homeowner's should be given an additional grace period to make their payment to the New Servicer.#ms.4.2
u,There are various holes in these regulations that will continue to be exploited by the Insurance Trackers or Force-Placed Insurers, who act on behalf of the Loan Servicers:#ms.11.0
u,* The wording on the letter doesn't matter,#ms.11.1
n,because the outside of the envelope does not state anywhere that it is from the Loan Servicers nor that it is important information regarding their mortgage.#ms.11.2
u,This means borrowers will likely overlook the notice no matter how well the letter is written.#ms.11.3
n,* No loan servicer's website currently allows a borrower to update their insurance information online.#ms.11.4
n,This can only be done via Assurant or QBE First's generic 3rd party websites.#ms.11.5
u,In today's digital age, there should be a way for borrowers to PROACTIVELY provide this information, rather than being guided toward a confusing unknown website.#ms.11.6
n,In the case of Wells Fargo, for example, a borrower would need to go to separate websites for their home and auto loan, since QBE First processes their auto insurance information, while Assurant processes their mortgage insurance information.#ms.11.7
u,This is confusing and unacceptable.#ms.11.8
u,* A borrower should be able to speak to an actual employee of the Loan Servicer.#ms.11.9
n,Currently ANY insurance related interaction  is handled by the Insurance Tracker or Force-Placed Insurer.#ms.11.10
u,This is especially upsetting in a claims situation where the Insurance Tracker acts as both parties  and the borrower's interests are completely ignored.#ms.11.11
u,* The Insurance Tracker and Force-Placed Insurer should not be allowed to be the same company, nor subsidiaries, nor any other version the banksters can come up with.#ms.11.12
n,There is rampant abuse created by this conflict of interest.#ms.11.13
u,The beginning of this section makes it sound like it only applies to Hazard insurance,#ms.14.0
n,however a "Hazard" LPI policy covers both Hazard and Wind or Hurricane.#ms.14.1
n,In addition, there is a LPI Flood product.#ms.14.2
n,In states where a separate wind policy is necessary  the placement of these policies creates an issue of duplicated coverage.#ms.14.3
n,This happened en masse in 2009 when most major insurance companies  stopped underwriting wind policies in Florida.#ms.14.4
n,The negative escrow accounts created by false placement of duplicate coverage are how Florida became one of the leading states for foreclosure.#ms.14.5
u,Remember that escrow accounts are PREPAID insurance accounts,#ms.14.6
n,so when a LPI policy is place, and the Loan Servicer processes an escrow analysis on the loan, the borrower is given 1 year to make up for 2 years of insurance payments.#ms.14.7
u,To make matters worse, the LPI premiums are inflated, and often backdated,#ms.14.8
u,so often the borrower is given much less time to make up for this negative escrow balance.#ms.14.9
u,If an escrow analysis is completed on a borrower with LPI, the premium can drive their monthly mortgage payment up by as much as 1000% to make up for this deficit.#ms.14.10
u,In addition, they can not qualify for a loan modification while they have a negative escrow balance#ms.14.11
u,which is normally caused by the bank's recommendation not to pay their mortgage while the loan mod is processed.#ms.14.12
u,Force-Placed Insurance is why so few borrowers have qualified for the HAMP and FHA loan modification programs.#ms.14.13
n,If a borrower does not have an escrow account for their loan , one is automatically created by the loan servicing system as soon as the loan is flagged to be placed in an LPI letter cycle.#ms.14.14
u,Think again.#ms.14.15
n,All of this is actually done by a 3rd party Insurance Tracker.#ms.14.16
n,The 2 largest Insurance Trackers in the US are Assurant and QBE First or Praetorian .#ms.14.17
u,If these companies sound familiar, it is because they are also the Force-Placed Insurers.#ms.14.18
u,This is how the kickback scheme works,#ms.14.19
u,and this is why voluntary companies like State Farm, USAA and Allstate don't provide the Force-Placed Insurance "product" to anybody.#ms.14.20
u,LPI should not even be a product.#ms.14.21
n,The Insurance Tracker is providing the service of placing insurance on a loan.#ms.14.22
n,They are simply choosing to only place their in-house proprietary insurance.#ms.14.23
n,When you send your insurance information to your Loan Servicer to prove you have insurance, it is actually received by the Insurance Tracker.#ms.14.24
u,Check the volume of UTL  documents these Insurance Trackers recycle on a daily basis,#ms.14.25
n,and you'll see that they "lose" literally tens of thousands of insurance documents every day.#ms.14.26
u,Please read my blog to see how this occurs:#ms.14.27
n,Now...another issue is that a loan servicing transfer  will create a "Deletion of Interest" cancellation.#ms.14.28
n,This often create an issue in both home and auto loans where a borrower will be saddled with LPI coverage despite doing nothing to trigger the event.#ms.14.29
n,These Insurance Trackers can't seem to track your insurance from one of their servicing portfolios to another.#ms.14.30
n,As for Escrow vs non-Escrow, as I've stated previously, the servicing system will AUTOMATICALLY CREATE an escrow account in the event of a non-escrow account.#ms.14.31
n,Currently the Insurance Trackers divide the mail received into queues,#ms.14.32
u,meaning they are purposely dividing them to treat escrow and non-escrow accounts different.#ms.14.33
u,It is very simple to remove these systematic rules from their system to ensure all insurance documents are handled the same.#ms.14.34
u,They are flat out lying when they say it is difficult.#ms.14.35
n,There are absolutely no practical problems,#ms.14.36
u,and I'd be happy to provide a sworn testimony in court to that effect.#ms.14.37
u,The servicer already uses the "overly broad" argument.#ms.16.0
e,While some of my QWR questions where answered more than once, other very relevant questions where not.#ms.16.1
e,My servicer refuses to answer these questions, saying they are overly broad.#ms.16.2
u,I think these questions were very precise.#ms.16.3
e,I took my servicer 62 business days to deny answering these questions.#ms.16.4
u,If they servicers can't handle the business, they should get out.#ms.16.5
e,By the time I have payed of my $ 200,000 loan I will have payed $ 500,000 total.#ms.16.6
u,For $ 300,000 I think I can demand a little service.#ms.16.7
u,All phone calls should be tracked and recorded, regardless of the Servicer's size.#ms.22.0
n,Customer Service is Customer Service.#ms.22.1
u,It is not a borrower's responsibility to judge the size of the company serving them.#ms.22.2
e,* I bought my home in 2001.#ms.23.0
e,CITIMORTGAGE later purchased my mortgage.#ms.23.1
e,From 2001-2009 I made all my payments on    time.#ms.23.2
e,In early 2009 I asked for a 3 month deferment on the payments while awaiting my disability to go through  and payments to begin.#ms.23.3
e,* I was then told I qualified for a "loan modification" and that it would reduce my payments and interest rate and make them more affordable.#ms.23.4
e,* I was advised not to send in any payments during the modification.#ms.23.5
e,The bank would not accept them.#ms.23.6
e,* They would let me know when to start making payments again.#ms.23.7
e,Then the paperwork and reps process began.#ms.23.8
e,* I sent in the paperwork at least four dozen times and went through many steps and departments.#ms.23.9
e,* I sent the same paperwork again, again, and again.#ms.23.10
e,* In 2009 And 2010 I  was put on temporary payment programs.#ms.23.11
e,I made all the payments on time.#ms.23.12
e,* For six months they were elevated payments and made all the elevated payments on time.#ms.23.13
e,* Then back to the modification process and no payments accepted again by the bank.#ms.23.14
e,* In June the modification process was closed because I could not furnish a letter from SS on how long I would be on    disability.#ms.23.15
u,That's like asking someone how long do you plan on being employed at your job.#ms.23.16
e,There is no timeline I told them.#ms.23.17
e,Social Security's answer with regards to this is "indefinite"#ms.23.18
e,I am on it till I get well, which doesn't look anytime soon.#ms.23.19
e,I sent them a Dr. note outlining a time frame as much as possible.#ms.23.20
u,That's all I can get to do so.#ms.23.21
e,* I am now over $45,000 in debt over a three-month deferment and am in imminent threat of losing my home.#ms.23.22
e,* We are a family of two adults and five children that are going to be put on the streets in Cassellbery Florida.#ms.23.23
u,* This is a widespread problem and they might as well be getting away with murder doing this to people.#ms.23.24
u,This has to be put to a stop immediately.#ms.23.25
u,Please help my family stay in our beloved home.#ms.23.26
u,THEY ARE USING THE H.A.M.P PROGRAM IN A PREDATORY WAY!#ms.23.27
u,DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ALSO.#ms.23.28
u,PLEASE FILE A COMPLAINT ON MY BEHALF.#ms.23.29
u,Yes, all loan origination documentation, loan servicing history, customer contact history, etc should be transferred.#ms.41.0
n,If I were to transfer from 1 school to another or 1 primary care provider to another, all of my records are transferred along with me.#ms.41.1
n,With servicing transfers, this is often not done.#ms.41.2
u,Also the new servicer should be given a specific deadline to have all of the missing customer information boarded into their systems.#ms.41.3
n,As this is often done en masse and electronically,#ms.41.4
u,it should take no more than 5 days, but let's say 15 days just to be nice.#ms.41.5
u,Also, the burden of filling in this missing information should be on the loan servicer, NOT the borrower.#ms.41.6
u,I don't see any reason why if my bank decides to sell my portfolio, it's suddenly my problem to resubmit information before being hit with fees.#ms.41.7
n,I didn't ask to be part of a portfolio they sold.#ms.41.8
u,That's all banking issues that I, as a consumer, should have no responsibility in.#ms.41.9
u,The list looks fine on the surface,#ms.42.0
u,but I'm not fully versed on all possible loan servicing abuses.#ms.42.1
u,I only know what I've seen.#ms.42.2
u,I don't like the idea of a set "covered error" list,#ms.42.3
u,but right now I can't think of a better solution.#ms.42.4
u,I'll spend some time pondering and let you know if I come up with any suggestions on this front.#ms.42.5
u,* The Loan Servicer should be required to disclose that you are being transferred to a 3rd party vendor.#ms.45.0
n,When you click a link for turbotax on irs.gov, for example.#ms.45.1
n,It will tell you that you are about to leave the site.#ms.45.2
u,It's a deceitful practice that is abused.#ms.45.3
u,* Representatives from the Insurance Tracker should have to introduce themselves as the insurance tracker .#ms.45.4
u,When you have insurance on your cell phone, for example, the representative  ALWAYS informs you that you will be speaking to a 3rd party insurance service to file a claim.#ms.45.5
u,* The Insurance Tracker should NEVER be allowed to also act as the Force-Placed Insurer.#ms.45.6
u,The mortgage company and insurance company should always be separate entities in order to protect the borrower.#ms.45.7
u,Allowing an Insurance Tracker to act as both creates a situation where they will act in their own interests first,#ms.45.8
u,then they will act in the loan servicer's interests,#ms.45.9
n,as they are a large portfolio client.#ms.45.10
u,In this scenario the borrower always loses.#ms.45.11
u,Allowing Force-Placed Insurers to act as Insurance Trackers led to a situation where many Hurricane Katrina claims are STILL unresolved TO THIS DAY!#ms.45.12
u,That is completely unacceptable and should in fact be considered illegal.#ms.45.13
u,This set up also negates the servicing industry's claims that LPI premiums are so high because they are blindly insuring.#ms.45.14
u,The reality is that the representatives from the Force-Placed Insurer have usernames that allow them to log into the mortgage servicing system.#ms.45.15
n,They also have all prior insurance information, claim information, etc.#ms.45.16
n,Many representatives have even deeper access to your account.#ms.45.17
n,This means they actually have MORE access to property information than a voluntary insurance company such as Farmers, Allstate, etc.#ms.45.18
n,In many cases they even have more access than the Loan Servicer.#ms.45.19
u,This is all highly suspect and needs to be stopped immediately.#ms.45.20
n,The borrower already can ask their banks questions over the phone.#ms.47.0
e,I have tried "over the phone" a lot.#ms.47.1
e,I have heard they have the original note at a time when they were not supposed to have it.#ms.47.2
e,I have heard "we don't have the note" when they were supposed to have it.#ms.47.3
e,Very simple questions such as the amount of reinstatement fees have gone unanswered over the phone.#ms.47.4
u,In hindsight I wish I would have recorded some of the phone conversations.#ms.47.5
n,I costs the consumer more time and money to request information in writing - not the servicer.#ms.47.6
u,I can only advise homeowners to have it all in written form and send it by certified mail.#ms.47.7
u,I don't think homeowners have any benefit by asking questions over the phone .#ms.47.8
u,When borrowers call in for information or documents, Borrowers should be sent limited access permission to view only their account information and loan documents  in the company document viewer portals,#ms.48.0
u,borrowers should be permitted to print out all docs found in their loan records.#ms.48.1
n,This automated process is relatively cost free for the institution and allows the borrowers to gain access to requested docs, and also information pertaining to servicing issues.#ms.48.2
u,Should the borrower have additional needs beyond this there should be a special link the borrower can intiate in the portal to request additonal information or personal contact from the institution.#ms.48.3
n,The institution can use this individual posting board to communicate with the borrower, log comments and actions regarding borrowers inquiry.#ms.48.4
u,This posting board or communication log should be fully accessible by the borrower with complete transparentcy.#ms.48.5
u,From a technical standpoint, direct access to a loan servicer's web based client portal via a simple username or password is impractical.#ms.49.0
n,There are many technical settings, VPN's, etc that are set up when vendors access these.#ms.49.1
n,What they can do, however, is build the code and databases to allow borrowers to access this information via their consumer websites.#ms.49.2
u,They also need a way for borrowers to be able to submit, review, and update insurance information on these websites.#ms.49.3
n,Many servicers, such as Bank of America, already have customer service available via chat through their website as well.#ms.49.4
u,Chat could be an option for customers who are weary of speaking to a representative over the phone and would like a record of the conversation.#ms.49.5
u,Either way, you have the right idea that these companies need to both upgrade and better utilize their technological capabilities.#ms.49.6
u,The answers to my QWR were quite surprising.#ms.51.0
e,The servicer might argue they have too high of costs and burden to reply and that some are "overly broad".#ms.51.1
e,However, the servicer had no problem providing me pages and pages of payoff statement and payment history#ms.51.2
e,However, even after they wrote me that they checked the reinstatement fees and confirmed those as "correct" they cannot itemize even half of them.#ms.51.3
u,That would take one or two pages to print out and mail - much easier than the information they were willing to provide.#ms.51.4
u,That request was "too broad".#ms.51.5
u,So yes, the servicer can call too broad what ever they want to.#ms.51.6
u,I will now write a new QWR asking again for itemization of the fees.#ms.51.7
u,As a bank they should be able to find out how they themselves came up with that number -#ms.51.8
n,especially as they have checked them and confirmed in writing that they were correct.#ms.51.9
u,By the way - the confirmation about the fees being correct came in writing and a copy went to the CFPB.#ms.51.10
u,I don't believe I would have gotten an answer at all if I had not complained with the CFPB.#ms.51.11
u,And here is a suggestion for the servicer to cut cost:#ms.51.12
e,in pre-foreclosure we received a "Home Transition Guide" - magazine style and no doubt expensive to print and send that we really didn't care for.#ms.51.13
e,During the Hamp modification trial we received the same request for our tax returns via Fed Ex over and over again .#ms.51.14
e,Also, ten days after we reinstated, they send Fed Ex AGAIN with a note that we needed to short sale or give them the deed in lieu of foreclosure.#ms.51.15
u,One would think they own Fed Ex as much as they use it.#ms.51.16
u,Some servicers are either completely ineffective with internal communication or they really enjoy throwing money at Fed Ex.#ms.51.17
u,Also: the proposed clause "for information it can't get from its records in the "ordinary course of business" with "reasonable efforts" is downright inviting fraud.#ms.51.18
u,They need the original promissory note with endorsements or allonge to assign it when the loan is transferred.#ms.51.19
n,Since the ordinary course of their business has become robo-signing,#ms.51.20
u,it makes it even easier to deny the request of a copy of the endorsed note.#ms.51.21
u,this exclusion would give them right to hide fees from their affiliates.#ms.51.22
u,That could make the game of inflated maintenance fees in foreclosure, force placed insurance, unearned kickback fees, attorney fees a whole new chance.#ms.51.23
u,If a servicer charges these fees, they should know what they are for and have no problem of disclosing.#ms.51.24
u,the servicer already successfully denies to answer QWR that can be interpreted as nothing but harassment.#ms.51.25
u,No I don't.#ms.51.26
u,My conclusion is that the servicers just don't want to inform the consumers.#ms.51.27
n,In the year 2012 they can get all the information tied to a borrowers loan with a few strokes on the keyboard.#ms.51.28
u,Nothing too difficult.#ms.51.29
u,It is just that some information they DO NOT WANT TO GIVE.#ms.51.30
u,The CFPB's only role is to protect the consumer.#ms.51.31
u,They should not even have to worry about making it easier for or less costly for the servicer or the bank.#ms.51.32
u,My servicer chose to spend money on hiring a high profile law firm only to  answer my QWR entirely.#ms.51.33
u,Well - that is their choice.#ms.51.34
u,If the CFPB gives the servicers a pass on not giving information more than a year after a servicing transfer, it is IMPERATIVE that the rules for a full information servicing transfer are solid and enforced.#ms.53.0
n,That has been addressed in another section,#ms.53.1
u,Loss of information between 2 banks at no fault to the borrower should never be allowed,#ms.53.2
n,and it happens all too often in the current environment.#ms.53.3
n,all of the information is instantaneously available.#ms.53.4
u,If it's not, it's the bank's fault, not the borrower's.#ms.53.5
u,It is "reasonable" to expect that if you lent me $100,000 that you would be able to tell me absolutely ANYTHING I ask about that $100,000 within a 5 minute phone conversation.#ms.53.6
u,If anyone needs an illustration, lend me $100,000 in cash right now from 1 private citizen to another.#ms.53.7
n,You are 1 person,#ms.53.8
n,and I am 1 person.#ms.53.9
u,I'm willing to bet I can call you at any time,#ms.53.10
u,and you will know how much I owe you.#ms.53.11
u,A professional should always be better than an amateur.#ms.53.12
u,That's why they're professionals.#ms.53.13
u,If they're not better, they will be displaced.#ms.53.14
u,That's how capitalism works.#ms.53.15
u,If they haven't been displaced, there is corruption in the air.#ms.53.16
n,For "overbroad" and "unduly burdensome" information or "unreasonable volume of documents or information" I have to point out that there are hundreds of employees at every servicer capable of creating queries that can be implemented and applied quite easily  to pull ANY and ALL loan information for a specific borrower.#ms.53.17
n,It can all be exported into a spreadsheet, PDF, image file, and more.#ms.53.18
u,It is a simple process and can be attached to the SQL GUI's utilized by every loan servicer with very minimal effort or cost to the servicer.#ms.53.19
u,There is absolutely no excuse not to be able to provide any information within 5 minutes.#ms.53.20
u,It is not a borrower's fault that the banks lost their information,#ms.53.21
u,and if the situation were reversed, the borrower would not be given  45 days or any types of excuses.#ms.53.22
u,Use your physical debit card anywhere in the world.#ms.53.23
u,Sign into your bank account 15 minutes later.#ms.53.24
u,The charge will show in your account.#ms.53.25
u,Write a check to pay one of your bills.#ms.53.26
u,Within 5 business days , an image of that check will be available online.#ms.53.27
u,It is criminal racketeering,#ms.53.28
u,and it needs to be stopped,#ms.53.29
u,and they need to be thoroughly punished for these continued crimes.#ms.53.30
u,These CFPB rules thus far are a complete joke.#ms.53.31
u,In contacting a customer, emails and text messages should be allowed,#ms.56.0
u,but they should be done in conjunction with the 3 phone calls, not in lieu of them.#ms.56.1
u,For example, if the loan servicer has an email address available, after the 3 phone calls, they should be required to try 3 emails.#ms.56.2
u,Starting contact efforts 16 days out should be completely fine if a borrower opts in for text messaging.#ms.56.3
u,A simple text of "Your mortgage payment is now due. Payment must be received by  to avoid any late fees or collection efforts. If you are unable to make your payment, please contact  at  for alternative options." text would actually be a great customer service option.#ms.56.4
u,It may be good to mirror these after Fair Debt Collection practices.#ms.56.5
u,The servicing systems need to be updated  to ensure that once a borrower accepts a loss mitigation option, these notification options are properly updated.#ms.56.6
u,For example, there's no need to keep calling someone to say their payment is late if they've already begun the forebearance process,#ms.56.7
u,the loan term change should update the contact dates, etc.#ms.56.8
u,Also, if a borrower has a HELOC, 2nd mortgage, or is listed as a co-borrower any other property, they should all be considered together at the time of the initial call.#ms.56.9
u,These accounts should all be linked so that a borrower facing default on 3 loans for the same property is not overwhelmed, confused, etc.#ms.56.10
u,The written notice approach seems like it'll work.#ms.57.0
u,The samples are as clear as they can be.#ms.57.1
u,Most borrowers won't understand any of it anyway.#ms.57.2
u,The biggest thing is to ensure they know who they can contact and making sure the c or s reps are fully trained on proper options and disclosures.#ms.57.3
u,I would definitely recommend that a written notice of confirmation is sent to the borrower for any changes made to their account as well.#ms.57.4
n,While it may not fully assist them,#ms.57.5
n,and they may choose to ignore the letters,#ms.57.6
u,it will help an attorney in discovering useful foreclosure defense information if it gets to that point.#ms.57.7
u,From a servicer standpoint, it is very simple for a large or small servicer to create letter templates and systematically fill in the appropriate dates, amounts, customer info, etc.#ms.57.8
n,This technology is built into loan servicing software suites,#ms.57.9
u,and if a company can't afford loan servicing software, they really have no business servicing loans.#ms.57.10
u,Just like with banking statements, a borrower should have the option to opt in for paperless.#ms.59.0
n,If they do, everything can be handled via the web, and email or text notifications can be sent.#ms.59.1
u,These notifications should contain the exact same information as the paper statement.#ms.59.2
n,They would just be received earlier#ms.59.3
n,since there's no physical mail involved.#ms.59.4
n,Again, since everything can be done electronically,#ms.59.5
u,there needs to be a way for borrowers to view or update their insurance information electronically through the loan servicer, without having to go to Assurant or QBE's highly deceptive websites.#ms.59.6
u,If a borrower doesn't want electronic access, that is their choice.#ms.59.7
n,Servicers such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and JPMorgan already have websites set up.#ms.59.8
u,Adding mortgage or insurance information should not be difficult and should already have been done.#ms.59.9
u,This addresses nothing in my example.#ms.61.0
e,They notified me of LMO's but then hid the fact they applied extra risk percentage of 2.5%, meaning the NPV caluculated by my using the HAMP site did not match the NPV value they came up with, since Wells Fargo was adding unbeknown to consumers 2.5% risk to the prime.#ms.61.1
u,Telling them all the LMO's means nothing if they do not have full disclosures on the numbers used in the NPV model their calculations, and their deteminations.#ms.61.2
u,They should not be able to disqualify anyone from a LMO unless they fully disclose all the calculations used to determine that disqualification.#ms.61.3
u,The lender should not be able to place forced insurance and replace the primary titled owner as the beneficiary of any loss policy issued on an pre forclosure asset,#ms.63.0
u,until forclosure occurs, the DEED is and remains in the ownership under homestead laws of most states, the borrower's legal property.#ms.63.1
u,I can understand the insurance requirement.#ms.63.2
u,The borrower should not be required to assume debt, that defies market logic,and then be liable for that debt being issued when they can derive no direct benefit from it, not even policy ownership.#ms.63.3
u,Also the lender should be required to obtain insurance at prevailing fair market insurance rates the regular consumer pays at the very most,#ms.63.4
e,when I was forced into REO due to default, and on medical disability, the monthly insurance cost was three times the annual cost of my then existing annual allstate policy cost.#ms.63.5
e,Which had also had additonal riders including liability umbrellas, for my auto and additional personal medical for visitors, comprehensive platinum content coverage,#ms.63.6
u,it belies common sense that they be allowed to fleece and abuse already indigent homeowners, like that. Charging 3 times what my full policy costs in a year, in a single month, and not even convering the whole contents of the house.#ms.63.7
u,They should have to use and provide traditional carrier insurance throught market channels at prevailing fair market insurance rates for the property,#ms.63.8
u,the policy should be CO-owned with both borrower and lender listed as beneficiaries of any REO policy especially if being billed to the escrow account,#ms.63.9
u,anything less is the abuse of the fiduciary of escrow.#ms.63.10
e,I had no problem blindly insuring my house with my current carrier from six states away,#ms.63.11
e,in fact they knew the number of claims ever filed on the property being insured as well as any claims I had filed on the property I owned prior to this one.#ms.63.12
u,All of this over inflation claim of excessive risk on REO insurance is a scam designed to insure they overcome the bankruptcy discount on cram downs.#ms.63.13
u,It prevents qualification for LMO's prevents curing of default as well.#ms.63.14
u,There is NO reason for it.#ms.63.15
n,REO and Force-Placed Insurance are 2 different products.#ms.64.0
u,The REO policy shouldn't have a borrower's name as the beneficiary because it is placed on a property post-foreclosure,#ms.64.1
u,however, you are 100% correct that these policies should NOT be charged to the borrower's escrow account ,#ms.64.2
u,and a borrower should NOT be held responsible for any REO charges whatsoever.#ms.64.3
n,Currently, escrow accounts are systematically added to EVERY foreclosure.#ms.64.4
n,The point it happens is dependent on the state and whether the lender is FNMA, FMAC, or other.#ms.64.5
n,These illegally created escrow accounts are illegally saddled with exorbitant MONTHLY REO premiums,#ms.64.6
n,which end up being charged to the borrower, NOT the lender.#ms.64.7
u,This is also an example of rampant racketeering and mortgage abuse,#ms.64.8
u,but it is a separate issue from the Force-Placed premiums falsely placed on mortgages, automobile liens, and other collateral loans.#ms.64.9
u,No, It doesn't.#ms.65.0
n,The new industry practice is that loss Mitigation or modifications are to be offered IF it is financially better for the INVESTOR to modify the homeowner instead of foreclosing, a positive net present value.#ms.65.1
u,But the proposed rules are just a delay for Wall Street to continue business as usual with no regard for fairness or equality, when there were over 5 million modifications issued to avoid the investors fiancial loss when negative equity was involved, setting the new industry practice or legal precedent what is offered in the normal course of business for negative equity homeowners.#ms.65.2
u,The home was bought and the mortage was invested in under the principles of capitalism,#ms.65.3
u,we need our governmental agencies to not only recongnize this but to act on it.#ms.65.4
n,There is no capitalistic financial difference to the homeowner or investor in a foreclosure situation when the property has a loan to value of 135%, 100%, 115% etc..#ms.65.5
u,The modification being offered is a financial incentive to remain a negative equity homeowner avoiding the investor from taking a financial loss from a foreclosure situation.#ms.65.6
u,My argument is unless we treated housing as the capitalistic product it is, there will be no recovery.#ms.65.7
u,What is being proposed is that we continue to allow the "fox in the hen House" making their own decisions on who gets a modification or gets foreclosed on based on totally unrevelant factors,#ms.65.8
u,this is what must be changed.#ms.65.9
u,All homeowners have a built in reliance because of existing laws that Wall Street would have to act with good faith and fair dealings with them.#ms.65.10
n,It would be impossible to give a 60 day notice on a rate change,#ms.67.0
n,when the index you use is supposed to be 45 days prior to the change date, as written in the original note signed by the borrower.#ms.67.1
u,Strongly support the concept of advanced notice on the "price shock".#ms.69.0
u,It will not however save the consumer from a questionable prior financial decision .#ms.69.1
u,That is why presenting the critical information upfront, in a standard form single page 10-12point font that emphasizes the reality of the financial agreement they are being presented with, is the real practical force and effect of this rule secrion.#ms.69.2
e,We received our notice of servicing as outlined here,#ms.73.0
e,however, the company doing the servicing did not have all the correct information and did not honor the temporary modification outlined by the previous servicer causing us untold hardship and stress.#ms.73.1
e,Because of their delay in information and application they immediately came after us for charges and late fees that we could not have avoided.#ms.73.2
u,It was unfair and predatory.#ms.73.3
e,In addition, our previous lender did not work fairly with us,#ms.73.4
e,but now that they have sold our loan they no longer have to work with us to correct the flaws in our loan,#ms.73.5
u,they simply wash their hands#ms.73.6
u,and the new lender or servicer can truthfully say it was not "their" fault.#ms.73.7
u,This option does not take into account the fraud perpetrated by many lenders.#ms.74.0
n,While they manipulated LIBOR rates and charged outrageous interest, lying to homebuyers about the loans and ignoring phone calls and pleas for workouts until it was too late to fix the problem.#ms.74.1
n,The lenders were required to write modifications by our government,#ms.74.2
n,however it was not legally enforceable#ms.74.3
n,so they played games with borrowers by dragging out the modification process until the borrower missed a payment or became dismally discouraged or lost a job.#ms.74.4
n,Many of these lenders are still playing games with the homebuyers and not working with them, but foreclosing with impunity.#ms.74.5
u,I think that lenders should be forced to include principle write-downs as part of their "workout" to prevent foreclosure.#ms.74.6
u,That principle is an ancient one, Armory v. Delamirie, 1 Strange 505#ms.74.7
u,The amount of information that is publicly available regarding the fraud that brought us into this place should be enough evidence that the homebuyer should not have to bear this burden alone.#ms.74.8
u,It is time to get some real relief for the homebuyers#ms.74.9
u,* currently their are more foreclosed homes than families without homes, and no sign of letting up.#ms.74.10
u,The consumer cannot continue to carry this fraud alone#ms.74.11
u,* we did not initiate it.#ms.74.12
u,The way the statement is broken down is fine .#ms.78.0
u,What I mean is that even though it's provided on the statement, customer service reps  need to be required to disclose the same information to borrowers.#ms.78.1
u,In today's day and age of automatic payments and electronic transfers, it's important that ALL lines of communication are treated the same.#ms.78.2
n,Few people use snail mail,#ms.78.3
u,and in another 20 years, it'll likely be a thing of the past.#ms.78.4
u,Many of these regulation seem geared toward the past rather than the technological present and future.#ms.78.5
u,Transparency is ALWAYS the answer.#ms.78.6
u,The cost to enter the market or remain in the market shouldn't be a consideration.#ms.83.0
u,That's all between the investor and the servicers.#ms.83.1
u,If the investor  want to provide options for smaller servicers, that is up to their discretion.#ms.83.2
u,If you leave a small servicer exception, it will be used as a loophole for the larger banks to create subsidiaries and exploit these, much like they do with taxes.#ms.83.3
u,If a company in any industry can't handle the costs of that industry, then they have no business being in that industry.#ms.83.4
u,If there ends up not being enough servicers to service the loans, then that's something the investors need to look at.#ms.83.5
u,From my perspective, you're trying to fix the effects rather than the cause.#ms.83.6
u,The servicers are all about making a buck.#ms.89.0
u,They need to be held to mortgage modification offers.#ms.89.1
u,If they lose paperwork, it needs to be on them, NOT the homeowner.#ms.89.2
u,Modifications should be processed and approved with or without paperwork.#ms.89.3
e,Yes, and after calling 3 times and sending 3 emails, they must send 3 singing telegrams.#ms.92.0
u,Let's be realistic here,#ms.92.1
u,the borrower needs to take some responsibility#ms.92.2
u,since they should know they are delinquent on their loan.#ms.92.3
u,I think three phone calls on three separate days is more than a good faith effort.#ms.92.4
u,If the consumer fails to notify the bank that they changed their phone number, it once again points to the negligence of the consumer.#ms.92.5
u,These rules are so restrictive that new systems and staff training has to be implemented.#ms.92.6
u,This is going to drive up the costs and fees associated with getting a mortgage in the first place.#ms.92.7
u,One phone call or contact of some sort should be more than enough effort on the lender's side.#ms.92.8
u,The consumer knows they are delinquent and needs to take some responsibility for their actions.#ms.92.9
u,I agree that a change should be made if the borrower has already negotiated terms so that they aren't repeatedly contacted.#ms.92.10
u,It would be beneficial to have a proper breakdown of where a mortgage payment is going.#ms.96.0
e,My current lender puts the information on the statement#ms.96.1
u,but it is so disorganized that I can't tell what went to interest, escrow, PMI, etc.#ms.96.2
u,This would be another software change that would require more of an expense to financial institutions.#ms.96.3
u,The cost of these changes has to be made up in income,#ms.96.4
u,which would ultimately come as a charge to the consumer.#ms.96.5
u,The comparisons you are making have no merit.#ms.98.0
u,You are missing the point here.#ms.98.1
u,Requirements like these can regulate smaller banks and credit unions right out of business.#ms.98.2
u,Then your only option would be to use a Wells Fargo-type bank for your mortgage loan.#ms.98.3
u,Small, rural institutions know their customer base and always make themselves available.#ms.98.4
u,I don't know if you have ever had an account with a smaller financial institution that knows your name when you walk in the door.#ms.102.0
u,That being said, the top few points you made deal with public health and safety,#ms.102.1
u,and the last deals with education.#ms.102.2
u,If you can please tell me how they relate to the financial industry that would be swell.#ms.102.3
n,My point is that in a small institution you will be able to speak with a person, either on the phone or face to face.#ms.102.4
n,They will always be reachable and in most cases you will be able to talk directly to the person who originated your loan.#ms.102.5
n,You would not get transferred 3 times and given the run-around that a large instituion tends to do.#ms.102.6
n,A small institution with 1-30 employees doesn't have the resources available to make large systems changes.#ms.102.7
u,If you do not work in the industry you would have no clue how much it costs to contract with a central processor.#ms.102.8
u,From your comments on every topic, I can tell that you are casting stones at the financial industry for some unknown reason.#ms.102.9
u,Small banks and credit unions were not the dishonest ones who tried to pull the wool over consumers eyes in the first place.#ms.102.10
u,All of the new proposals appear to be good and are what small banks have been doing for years.#ms.105.0
e,My small bank has over half of their loans in home mortgages and have not forclosed on one in over 10 years.#ms.105.1
u,Rules like this one could make it harder on small banks to work with customers and more expensive to make mortgage loans.#ms.105.2
e,As an advocate for homeowners in foreclosure, I am on the phone with servicers large and small every day.#ms.111.0
u,while foreclosure education is always needed,#ms.111.1
u,I think a more pressing issue is regulation of servicers who misrepresent their own investors and who decieve borrowers for their own financial gain.#ms.111.2
e,In several of our firms' cases major servicers have claimed they could not offer a loan modification to our our clients' because there was an "investor restriction."#ms.111.3
u,This would be valid if it were true,#ms.111.4
n,as investors are not required to to consent to a modification.#ms.111.5
n,However, oftentimes this is just an excuse the servicers use to keep a client in default and to keep raking in fees that benefit themselves#ms.111.6
n,investor's usually recieve principle and interest,#ms.111.7
n,while servicers recieve all the late fees, and other fees associated with servicing an account.#ms.111.8
u,There are few cases when there is a legitamite investor restriction.#ms.111.9
e,Anytime a servicer cites one, I ask for the name of the investor and the name and series of the trust the mortgage was probably pooled into.#ms.111.10
e,Then, if the trust is public I look it up on the SEC website t_url#ms.111.11
e,Then I open the Pooling and servicing agreement section which pertains to modifications.#ms.111.12
e,In 95% of cases the agreement petween the investor and the servicer gives the servicer the ability to recapitalize loans, reduce interest and or or reduce princible as they see fit.#ms.111.13
e,Oftentime the servicer is already modifying other loans within the portfolio in the same trust.#ms.111.14
e,We prove this by pulling up investor reports banks issue to their investors regarding each trust.#ms.111.15
e,When confronted with written proof that there is in fact no investor restriction, or that the restriction has been waived servicers will often retract their claim that there is a restriction.#ms.111.16
e,But then they often come up with another illegitamate excuse such as a modification denial due to NPV , or that the client needs to have their second mortgage subordinated .#ms.111.17
u,The problem is that few ordinary homeowners have the education or resources to push back against servicers.#ms.111.18
u,If the investors found out that their servicers were tanking their portfolio by not agreeing to profitable modifications  they would be outraged.#ms.111.19
n,Some of them do end up suing, from what I've heard.#ms.111.20
u,So yes, having servicers educate homeowners to their options is a great idea.#ms.111.21
u,But even when they are educated they will still lose their homes if the servicers are not not further regulated.#ms.111.22
n,Unfortunately many homeowners were decieved by many profit-driven companies at orginination ,#ms.111.23
u,and now they are being decieved on the back end when they need some real assistance to save them from losing their home.#ms.111.24
u,If the CFPB wants to do something about this, penalties against deceptive servicers would be a start.#ms.111.25
u,The CFPB could expand the covered error "Not providing accurate information to a borrower in trouble about loss mitigation options" to specifically include decpetive practices, such as improper denials i mentioned.#ms.112.0
u,This will pave the way for enforcement actions which will be necessary to check most for-profit servicers#ms.112.1
n,I understand that at a certain point when a loan is past due if the lender is continuing the foreclosure process that they can not accept payments,#ms.113.0
u,however I do not understand why they can't accept partial payments and apply them to the loan.#ms.113.1
n,By not accepting the payment unfortunately what happens is people pay something else that has to be paid.#ms.113.2
e,My previous employer serviced loans#ms.113.3
e,and we did all of the things being suggested, proactively called borrowers to setup a payment plan#ms.113.4
e,so they continued to receive funds.#ms.113.5
u,Most lender's are not like this and won't talk to you until you are delinquent and even tell you not to make the payment this is wrong and not helping the consumer that called prior to the loan being past due to try and resolve the situation.#ms.113.6
u,Lender's should be ashamed.#ms.113.7
e,As a previous servicer of accounts, the timeframes in which the servicer has to respond are VERY generous almost to generous,#ms.114.0
u,really this information is not that hard to provide especially if it is given verbally, written notices to the consumer would take longer.#ms.114.1
n,Congress directed CFPB to also consider the costs to the companies it's regulating and whether new rules will cut back on new lending to consumers.#ms.116.0
u,This has always been the threat from the banks:#ms.116.1
n,Well, they have already done that.#ms.116.2
u,This is not about cost cutting.#ms.116.3
e,I wrote a QWR to find out about fees#ms.116.4
n,and the servicer hires a high profile law firm so they don't have to answer.#ms.116.5
u,If they would not have attached unexplained fees, they would not have to spend money on lawyers.#ms.116.6
u,This is CAPITALISM.#ms.116.7
u,If the business doesn't make them enough profit, get out of the business.#ms.116.8
u,If illegal behavior will cost them, they should consider not doing it anymore.#ms.116.9
u,That all would cut their legal fees immensely.#ms.116.10
n,Most information can be provided electronically.#ms.117.0
u,If servicers are interested in cutting costs, they already have many electronic systems in place to provide this information.#ms.117.1
e,I've worked in the back end with these servicers.#ms.117.2
e,I know how their systems and SQL databases are connected.#ms.117.3
e,I know what reports are available.#ms.117.4
u,It is absolutely unacceptable for them to claim any information is "unreasonable" to retrieve.#ms.117.5
u,It is nothing more than an excuse they are using to keep anything from changing.#ms.117.6
u,For the record, there are VERY FEW "rules" that the CFPB are proposing that are any different than what the servicers already have in place.#ms.117.7
u,The fines are minimal,#ms.117.8
u,and the audits are a joke.#ms.117.9
u,In the 7 years I worked in the back end, there was only ever 2 audits,#ms.117.10
u,and in both cases, we were given a week's notice of the information what would be reviewed during the "surprise" audit.#ms.117.11
u,During this time, reports were adjusted, numbers were faked, and mistakes were hidden.#ms.117.12
u,I've seen nothing in these proposed "rules" that will have any affect whatsoever on any of the corrupt happenings I've witnessed during my career with the banks.#ms.117.13
e,I bought my home in 2005 and took out a fixed rate loan.#ms.118.0
e,I put $100,000 down and in 2005 it was worth $267,000.00.#ms.118.1
e,Now it is worth $144,000.00.#ms.118.2
e,I started my title company in 2004.#ms.118.3
e,In 2007, when the market tanked, we were able to stay afloat for 3 years.#ms.118.4
e,During this time period, we were on the equity acceleration program and were making 2 payments a month.#ms.118.5
e,We were attempting to get the loan paid off as quickly as possible.#ms.118.6
e,In 2009, I closed my company due to a lack of business.#ms.118.7
e,I was lucky to get a job a month after I closed the company and started making payments again.#ms.118.8
e,I was only behind on my mortgage 2 months.#ms.118.9
e,I tried to work with Chase later in 2010 to see if I could get the 2 months added to the back of the loan and was told that I could not afford the home.#ms.118.10
e,I told the rep that I was and had been making the payment.#ms.118.11
e,I am losing my home this year#ms.118.12
e,simply because the servicers of the loan would not work with me.#ms.118.13
e,I am not asking for a compliant to be filed#ms.118.14
e,because I have come to terms with what has happened to me and the fact that I am losing the home.#ms.118.15
u,What I want you to do is put regulations in place that will make these lenders work with homeowners.#ms.118.16
u,There are many homeowners who have been affected by what our government has allowed these lenders to do to the economy.#ms.118.17
u,Until we can create jobs and repair the economy, we are going to see the foreclosures rise.#ms.118.18
u,People cannot make their payment if they do not have a job.#ms.118.19
u,I have one more thing to say,#ms.118.20
u,If I or any other consumer forge someone's signature or fraudulently file a paper, and we are caught, I would go to jail, and would not be able to walk the streets and continue to hurt people.#ms.118.21
u,The Lenders need to be held accountable for their actions.#ms.118.22
u,I don't understand how they can conduct business like this without having to face the consequences for the wrong that they have done.#ms.118.23
u,I realize that many people chose to purchase a home that they really could not afford,#ms.118.24
u,but that does not give the right for the lender to foreclose with the incorrect paperwork or fraudulently signed papers.#ms.118.25
u,If they are going to take someones house, then they need to do it the right way, with the correct paperwork and signatures.#ms.118.26
u,It is not the homeowners fault that the lenders cannot get the appropriate paperwork signed at closing#ms.118.27
u,and it is also not their fault if the lenders cannot keep the documents in the file where they belong.#ms.118.28
u,I am sorry that the lenders do not have a system set up to where they can keep the paperwork safe for the time when they possibly need it.#ms.118.29
u,Lenders should be required to have people to assist you woth your loan at the branch.#ms.123.0
u,When I arrive at the branch they should not dictate to me an 800 number that keeps me on hold.#ms.123.1
u,When you state ALL borrowers, it truly should be ALL borrowers.#ms.127.0
u,My case is not unlike many thousands of homeowners across the Country,#ms.127.1
u,but I'll bet many have not even heard of this situation.#ms.127.2
n,Some servicers are now cutting off ALL contact with persons with past bankrutcies, no statements, no web access, no infomation on how much was paid in interest so the homeowner can't file income taxes etc etc etc...#ms.127.3
n,This is happening right now to homeowners everywhere.#ms.127.4
u,I think bankruptcy should not be used as an excuse to abuse homeowners who have already suffered enough.#ms.127.5
u,A rule protecting ALL borrowers needs to brough into focus.#ms.127.6
u,If the homeowner REQUESTS statements, then the servicer is not in violation of an automatic stay.#ms.127.7
u,So CFPB needs to close this loop where the servicers is abusing the homeowner.#ms.127.8
u,This trend is just starting,#ms.127.9
u,and with one rather notorious non-bank servicer now snapping up these servicing rights, more and more homeowners in or through bankruptcy will be shut off from any info on their loans.#ms.127.10
u,This is a simple fix for the CFPB without stepping on any BK rules,#ms.127.11
u,just require servicers to provide online access and monthly statements when the homeowner specifically requests.#ms.127.12
u,One major Force-Placed Insurance issue that needs to be addressed is how it is constantly referred to as a product.#ms.130.0
n,LPI is not a product.#ms.130.1
n,LPI is a service by definition.#ms.130.2
u,Whether you refer to it as Force-Placed or Lender-Placed, the point is that it is insurance that they are buying for you.#ms.130.3
u,They should ONLY be allowed to charge a maximum of $35  for the SERVICE of price shopping insurance for a consumer.#ms.130.4
u,They should be legally required to select the cheapest insurance available through this necessary force-placed insurance SERVICE .#ms.130.5
u,The collection of this $35 service fee would offset any of these mortgage servicing costs the CFPB feels should be passed on to consumers for creating a bill.#ms.130.6
e,* What I was clearly doing was bringing up examples of other "service" industries in order to illustrate the obvious connection that regulation in every other "service" industry is the same,#ms.131.0
u,and yet as soon as the words "mortgage" or "financial" are placed in front of the word "service" the regulations suddenly change.#ms.131.1
u,You are failing to see the forest for the trees.#ms.131.2
u,I'm not as easily fooled.#ms.131.3
u,This is why I compare the health "service" industry to the food "service" industry to the financial "service" industry.#ms.131.4
u,* In regards to your argument about small businesses being reachable, once again, laws have to be written in a consistent manner.#ms.131.5
u,Technically a corporation like Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, or Bank of America can make the exact claim you're making for small business, and with more validity.#ms.131.6
n,They have tens of thousands of worldwide branches and call centers staffed nearly 24 or 7 by tens of thousands of employees.#ms.131.7
n,They have websites that can be accessed globally.#ms.131.8
u,I can be on vacation in Tahiti and still view my balance on their website and possibly still even find a branch to talk to someone in person.#ms.131.9
u,Your small business can't do that,#ms.131.10
u,and therefore in the eyes of the law, they are not nearly as reachable as you think from your narrow viewpoint.#ms.131.11
u,* I know exactly how much it costs to make a system change.#ms.131.12
u,I know what systems are involved.#ms.131.13
u,In fact, if your small business is strapped for cash, I'd be more than happy to offer my services to assist in creating the templates necessary to create and send out a monthly bill to a customer.#ms.131.14
u,I'll do it for very cheap, because it's very easy to do.#ms.131.15
u,As a matter of fact, it's a feature built into any office program.#ms.131.16
u,If your mom and pop bank has Microsoft Office, they can do it within an hour.#ms.131.17
u,If they don't, they can download the freeware OpenOffice suite to accomplish the same task in the same amount of time.#ms.131.18
u,I can link everything to a SQL database,#ms.131.19
u,but as we're discussing a small mom and pop shop with 1-30 employees,#ms.131.20
u,they likely don't have enough customers to necessitate SQL servers.#ms.131.21
u,As a former employee of the mortgage servicing industry for clients such as JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Countrywide Home Loans, Aurora Loan Services, IndyMac Federal, OneWest Bank, Financial Freedom, Saxon Loan Services, Select Portfolio Services, PennyMac, Wachovia, Compass Bank, Downey Savings and Loans, GMAC, Homecomings Financial, Ally Financial, and more, I'd be happy more than happy to address any further concerns you may have and provide any additional training or education you may need in order to fully understand these rules as well as I do.#ms.131.22
n,There were late fees,#ms.132.0
n,they fee was $25 once the payment researched 10 days past due.#ms.132.1
e,The late fee was the last thing they collected#ms.132.2
n,and depending on the circumstances and the plan with the client to go foward many times the late fee was waived,#ms.132.3
n,their goal was to get the loan current and avoid foreclosure.#ms.132.4
n,A payment reminder and a call were made to the client after the account became past due 10 days,#ms.132.5
n,the servicer's goal was to discuss the situation with the client and propose options to get the account back on track.#ms.132.6
u,A majority of people want to work this out,#ms.132.7
u,they need help.#ms.132.8
n,The plan this agreement was followed up in a letter to the client and or or depending on the changes made may require the client to sign documents,#ms.132.9
n,these items were all taken care of prior to the loan being 30 days past due if the client was willing to work with the servicer.#ms.132.10
u,They encouraged people to be proactive.#ms.132.11
e,I had an instance where we had some medical things happen#ms.132.12
e,and I knew I was going to be late on a payment and called the servicer prior to the payment being due and was told there was nothing they could talk to me about and recommended I let the loan go past due!#ms.132.13
e,I had the funds to make 2 or 3's of the payment but unless it was a full payment they wouldn't accept it.#ms.132.14
u,I was horrified by this and the service I received.#ms.132.15
u,I know better because of my job#ms.132.16
u,but your everyday client doesn't#ms.132.17
u,and they trust what they are being told.#ms.132.18
u,These large servicers have a racket going.#ms.132.19
u,They need to get back to the mentally they are their to help the customer not go past due and find ways restructure.#ms.132.20
u,I can't believe there is a lender that would not wanted to receive additional dollars on an account and not go through the foreclosure process if possible.#ms.132.21
u,The cost of foreclosure for the lender is expensive,#ms.132.22
u,most times if you can work it would it is cheaper to work with the client.#ms.132.23
u,If the mentally was to correct and help clients work through their situation servicers would need people with more experience than they have which currently is a phone bank of people with canned answers.#ms.132.24
u,All of these proposals, rules and regulations are futile if there's nobody enforcing them.#ms.134.0
e,I've been working with my mortgage loan servicer for 9 months now trying to get a modification.#ms.134.1
e,I've had 4 different customer relationship managers and have always gotten voice mail every time I called.#ms.134.2
e,Occasionally I would get a call back but usually not.#ms.134.3
e,I have faxed and "fed-exed" my documents numerous times#ms.134.4
e,and each time they claim they did not receive them, even though I have fax confirmations and tracked the Fed-ex package to make sure it was delivered.#ms.134.5
u,I am completely frustrated with the whole process.#ms.134.6
e,I have been trying to get my payments lowered and keep sending and resending paperwork#ms.136.0
e,now I have been informed that there is nothing that can be done.#ms.136.1
e,My partner had to borrow against her 401K plan in order to get our mortgage caught up#ms.136.2
e,now we have been informed that our payment will be increased from 2016.26 to 2510,#ms.136.3
u,now this just seem very stupid to me#ms.136.4
e,since we were having a problem making the lower payment and wanted it lowered so it could be made from one of my paychecks.#ms.136.5
u,I feel that mortgages should use net income instead of gross income.#ms.136.6
u,That would prevent a lot of problems in my opinion.#ms.136.7
u,Not unless you have an efficient process to enforce those regulations.#ms.137.0
u,What would make it easier would be a requirement that the servicers have a system by which files could be uploaded electronically by the consumer through a secure, log-in to use type site.#ms.137.1
u,A site where consumers could see a document check-list and view which documents had been received as well as outstanding documents, due dates, messages, etc.#ms.137.2
e,Right now I am at the mercy of the customer relations manager.#ms.137.3
e,It's a "he said-she said" battle because I have sent documents,#ms.137.4
e,but they say they didn't get them.#ms.137.5
e,Even though I have fax confirmations and fed-ex tracking numbers that show delivery,#ms.137.6
e,I can't prove what documents were delivered.#ms.137.7
e,We are a SMALL community bank.  Assets of about $225 million.#ms.143.0
e,We service more than 1,000 loans#ms.143.1
e,ergo we're not a small servicer.#ms.143.2
u,CFPB was created by morons  and is run by morons for the benefit of morons.#ms.143.3
u,Consumers are going to get protection - good and hard!#ms.143.4
u,I believe that under any circumstances, both people  who are obligated, should be periodically getting some sort of update.#ms.144.0
u,However, if either of them changes the address to a p.o. box, or one separate from the home or property, there ought to be a provision that one monthly statement goes to the residence, unless both parties have a new separate address.#ms.144.1
u,Also, even if one person is only a quit claim party, or has signed as the dower, they are just as entitled to some sort of statement if something changes.#ms.144.2
u,It's really important.#ms.144.3
u,The additional communications, as proposed on this site, are a good thing, of and by themselves.#ms.145.0
u,However, I believe there is another problem that should be addressed, in addition.#ms.145.1
u,I suspect that many people who take out an ARM do not fully consider the risk of future rate increases.#ms.145.2
u,Especially with the currently low rates , ideally a prospective customer should perform a "stress-test" on their own financial situation, and ask realistically could they afford the loan if rates climb in the long term, and specifically how they would accomplish this.#ms.145.3
u,An alert is nice,#ms.145.4
u,but the options are far greater before the agreement is signed.#ms.145.5
u,Therefore, my recommendation would be to put equal--or greater--emphasis on clear communication and discussion of options before the loans are signed, with a focus on worst-case increases.#ms.145.6
u,e.g. "If rates do climb substantially, and your ARM rate goes to it's highest allowed level of __X%__, your monthly payment would be __$xx,xxx__.#ms.145.7
u,Even if the prospective customer doesn't provide an answer to the loan officer, that might trigger some very useful discussions among spouses, co-signers, etc#ms.145.8
u,I assume that lenders would detest such a requirement,#ms.145.9
u,but fundamentally we do need to enforce reality-checks at some stage:#ms.145.10
u,history and basic logic indicate that the people who are paid to generate loans are not the best guardians of long-term risk.#ms.145.11
u,i.e. how much of an increase could you really afford.#ms.145.12
u,Requiring a prospective borrower do the math might be a useful reality check -#ms.145.13
u,even if the person fudges the numbers, at least the issue will have been implanted in their head.#ms.145.14
u,Let me first give you some background#ms.147.0
u,so you can fully understand what has happened.#ms.147.1
e,My partner developed cancer without medical insurance.#ms.147.2
e,This catastrophic event eventually led me into bankruptcy.#ms.147.3
e,My partner died 3 weeks before I recieved the Chapter 7 discharge.#ms.147.4
e,Three weeks AFTER the discharge, I signed permanent HAMP modification documents that lowered the payment on my house.#ms.147.5
e,Even though it is well over $100,000 underwater,#ms.147.6
e,it is still my home#ms.147.7
u,and I want to keep it.#ms.147.8
e,My servicer honored the permanent agreement#ms.147.9
e,and I paid my mortgage every month for over a year with no issues.#ms.147.10
e,My servicer provided online access as well as monthly statements.#ms.147.11
e,the monthly statements have a disclaimer at the bottom that read: "Aurora Bank is a debt collector.#ms.147.12
e,Aurora Bank is attampting to collect a debt#ms.147.13
e,and any information obtained will be used for that purpose.#ms.147.14
e,However, if you are in bankruptcy or received a bankruptcy dischagre of the debt, this communication is not an attempt to collect the debt agaiinst you personall, but is notice of a possible enforcement of the lien against the collateral property."#ms.147.15
e,This statement protects the servicer against any automatic stay violations,#ms.147.16
e,it's standard throughout the industry.#ms.147.17
e,I was lucky to recieve a HAMP mod and was one of the success stories about HAMP.#ms.147.18
e,But suddenly Aurora closed,#ms.147.19
e,and the servicing rights went to a non-bank company.#ms.147.20
e,This is after over a year of success.#ms.147.21
e,The new servicer is the one not providing statements.#ms.147.22
e,They quote "It is our policy to deny online access to accounts and will not provide mortgage statements to anyone who has had a bankruptcy and did not reaffirm the loan".#ms.147.23
u,So this is not about violating any bankruptcy law,#ms.147.24
u,they simply choose to not cooperate, or worse are trying to leverage the statement information to get people to reaffirm!#ms.147.25
e,No bankruptcy judge would reaffirm a mortgage that was $100,000 underwater at the time.#ms.147.26
u,The judges go out of their way to not approve reaffirmation agreements because it is not in the best interest of the debtor. Simple as that.#ms.147.27
u,So the new servicer could easily just pick up where the old servicer left off,#ms.147.28
u,but they refuse based on their own unfair policy.#ms.147.29
u,Perhaps because they make more money on defaulting loans,#ms.147.30
u,they keep the fees#ms.147.31
u,and the investor gets what's leftover after a foreclosure sale.#ms.147.32
u,So if they make it difficult for the homeowner, many will just give up and walk away.#ms.147.33
u,The servicer then gets the "fees" after the sale.#ms.147.34
u,Also the non-bank servicer does not have to answer to most Government Financial regulations,#ms.147.35
n,the FDIC, Treasury, Office of Currency Comptroller do not oversee non-banks, so there is no way to file a complaint with them.#ms.147.36
u,I was lucky to find CFPB,#ms.147.37
u,I just pray you can intervene not only for me, but the many thousands more out there suffering though this latest nightmare.#ms.147.38
u,So in summary, a simple disclaimer is all the servicer needs for bankruptcy cases,#ms.147.39
u,The rules you propose still do not protect bankruptcy cases#ms.147.40
u,because the servicer is not required to include a disclaimer so the bankrupt homeowner can keep getting statements.#ms.147.41
u,Same with online accounts.#ms.147.42
u,This MAJOR servicer has found a loophole and is exploiting it.#ms.147.43
u,Here's a suggestion,#ms.147.44
u,maybe you could propose a rule that the servicer shall make a good faith effort to help homeowners with bankruptcies stay in their homes by offering statements with the standard disclosure phrase.#ms.147.45
u,By accepting the terms of the online agreement and the monthly statement, the homeowner would agree that it is not a viloation of the automatic stay.#ms.147.46
u,It's sad that I find myself battling a servicer a year after everything was stabilized.#ms.147.47
u,I am tired of fighting.#ms.147.48
u,I think this is a reasonable solution.#ms.149.0
u,Homeowners should be able to get answers over the phone,#ms.149.1
u,but then the servicer should be required to ask if they would like a written confirmation of the information.#ms.149.2
u,Of course, the homeowner should say "yes, please".#ms.149.3
u,People will not take your opinions seriously if you are derogatory.#ms.150.0
u,The problem with all of this is that the consumer doesn't understand all of the parties involved in his or her loan and might need that information in the case of a financial crisis of some kind.#ms.153.0
u,In addition to the servicer of the loan there is the question of who actually owns the loan#ms.153.1
u,and, if the loan has been bundled into some sort of security, perhaps the borrower should know that as well.#ms.153.2
u,Lack of clear records in this regard was exposed as a major problem during the 2008 crisis.#ms.153.3
u,So it seems to me that whenever any change occurs in any of the above, the mortgagee should receive a clear, concise picture of the situation.#ms.153.4
n,This is the organization to whom you actually owe the money. .and so on and so forth.#ms.153.5
u,A similar form should be sent when there's a change.#ms.153.6
u,each mortgage loan should have a unique universal identifier so things can be tracked properly.#ms.153.7
u,I.e., when a loan is packaged and sold in a structured security, the paperwork would have the unique IDs of all loans included in the package.#ms.153.8
u,Dear Moderator, As you may know, it has been the common public practice of bank regulators to listen to complaints from foreclosure fraud victims and respond by attempts at misdirection.#ms.156.0
u,Like children's birthday party magicians regulators halfheartedly attempt to distract their audience with a shiny object in one hand, such as information management proposals, while looking away from the truth of Wall Street prosecution failure in the other.#ms.156.1
n,This has become so common place in local hearings and legislative testimony it has spawned new phrases into the English language such as "Regulatory Theater" and "Enforcement Fraud".#ms.156.2
u,I support error correction.#ms.156.3
n,But error correction only corrects errors, not deceptive practices.#ms.156.4
u,A substantive response from the CFPB would have addressed Page 27 of the mutli-state lawsuit and advised when homeowners will be able to call their state attorney general or the CFPB to stop a deceptive foreclosure in progress.#ms.156.5
u,Homeowner's insurance should have a guaranteed re-issue policy in place for the mortgage servicer.#ms.157.0
u,The rate should be no more than the insurance cost in prior year.#ms.157.1
u,The mortgage servicer should be required to use this guaranteed re-issue policy.#ms.157.2
u,This simple and straightforward change would remove the potential for servicers and insurers to game the system.#ms.157.3
u,I have to disagree with this thoery.#ms.159.0
u,Real Estate is very much local,#ms.159.1
u,and everyone needs housing.#ms.159.2
n,Your proposal does not take into account that the average single home in San Francisco is valued well over $300,000.#ms.159.3
u,So is NYC, Honolulu, LA, San Diego...#ms.159.4
u,I don't know where you live,#ms.159.5
u,and perhaps a $300,000 home in your area is a benchmark for the well to do.#ms.159.6
u,But $300,000 is not even a starter home in some areas.#ms.159.7
u,Great plan for those in Ohio, not so great for those in California.#ms.159.8
u,Your misrepresentation in your signature line is amazingly bold.#ms.160.0
u,Clearly you are not researching#ms.160.1
u,you are a real estate industry stooge intent on confusing regulators.#ms.160.2
u,You confuse valuations  with economic value.#ms.160.3
u,You equate equate lack of government subsidy a punishment.#ms.160.4
u,In the plan proposed if Californians made more or had less other expenses such as transportation then there would be a greater house price to subsidize.#ms.160.5
u,However that is not the case in a bubble economy and a real estate market that confuses recent sals prices with economic value.#ms.160.6
e,For the record I am not in the real estate business,#ms.161.0
e,I'm in the military.#ms.161.1
u,So your rant is without merit.#ms.161.2
n,And the median home in your area of CO  is only $192,000,#ms.161.3
u,how convenient of you to suggest imposing rules on others that would not affect you.#ms.161.4
u,I will not resort to calling you names,#ms.161.5
u,your actions say it all for you.#ms.161.6
u,It looks like you want a debate,#ms.163.0
u,but I'm not interested.#ms.163.1
u,Try a debate team or something.#ms.163.2
u,I am in agreement with the form#ms.165.0
u,In this age of the Internet, I think there should be a rule requiring mortgage servicing companies to provide access to loan information online.#ms.173.0
e,I currently have a mortgage from a company who does not offer this.#ms.173.1
u,Since I often deal with financial matters at home after normal working hours, I much prefer having online access instead of having to make a phone call to get the information.#ms.173.2
u,The rule does not go far enough in terms of protecting the consumer from errors of the bank and allows the bank to put the consumer in a catch22.#ms.174.0
e,My lender errorneously determined that I was in a flood area and despite my protests  that I was not in a flood area went out and bought flood insurance at very high rates.#ms.174.1
e,When they finally evaluated my documentation they agreed to cancel the policy#ms.174.2
e,since I was not in a flood area but did not want to refund the cost of insurance for the time the insurance had been in place.#ms.174.3
e,It took many hours, calls, and esacalations, and preliminary discussions with attorneys to get the cost of the unnecessary insurance refunded.#ms.174.4
u,The system leaves consumers poorly defended and allows the bank to buy insurance at extremely high rates.#ms.174.5
u,*  If the insurance was place erroneously the bank has to refund all insurance payments and pay a penalty.#ms.174.6
u,*  The bank should only be allowed to buy insurance at a rate no greater than the leser of -- 10% of competitively priced polices or 10% greater than the rate the homeowner had been paying.#ms.174.7
u,*  The bank should have a time limit on how long it would have to inestigate.#ms.174.8
u,Just to let you know...it was the Force-Placed Insurer acting on behalf of your lender that determined your flood zone and placed the policy on your account.#ms.175.0
u,They are also the ones you spoke with every time you called your lender.#ms.175.1
e,I wrote a QWR to my new servicer.#ms.177.0
e,It took three weekes for them to send an aknowledgement letter back.#ms.177.1
e,I'm not a trial lawyer, just a consumer with very limited resources.#ms.177.2
u,The QWR was perhaps the only tool available to consumers to get information, eliminating it seems counterintuitive of what consumer protection is all about.#ms.177.3
u,I would be skeptical if that claim comes from the servicers.#ms.177.4
u,My QWR asked for a lot of information because the new servicer won't give me anything.#ms.177.5
u,CFPB needs to understand that some servicers will take advantage of whatever rules you impose,#ms.177.6
u,and if you want to protect the consumer you need to strengthen their rights, not weaken them.#ms.177.7
u,The partial payment issue is a tricky one,#ms.179.0
u,they should be required to accept and post partial payments,#ms.179.1
u,becuse it reduces the amount of interest and other charges on the loan especially for FHA and other govt backed loans.#ms.179.2
u,Their failure to accept partial payments maximizes their insurance claim to the govt.#ms.179.3
u,There is no way this should be allowed,#ms.179.4
u,if you want govt insurance of mortgage loans, then you the lender must accept and post every dollar to that loan before, you would be allowed to make any claim,#ms.179.5
u,any lender not doing that should forfiet their right to make a claim on a govt backed mortgage,#ms.179.6
u,failure to do that after they received bailout funds from the governement means they are only interested in maximizing their profits and reducing their risk completely at the taxpayers expense.#ms.179.7
u,They should have to credit them immediately,#ms.179.8
u,even if there is no negative reporting,#ms.179.9
u,because otherwise they are still engaging in harassing collection calls to borrowers#ms.179.10
e,I was told I hadn't made a payment even when I had, and that it "didn't count" even tho there were 2 months of suspense fund payments present,#ms.179.11
u,rather than working to resolve the actual problem, they seem in some cases more interested in getting an insurance claim for your mortgage than curing the default right now#ms.179.12
u,because the claim is worth more than the forclosed property due to market value changes.#ms.179.13
u,As an aside item, most lenders are now calling from the frist day of the grace period,#ms.179.14
u,lenders should no longer be allowed to call 20 times a day claiming you are late, while in the grace period for a payment if the loan is otherwise current.#ms.179.15
e,I studied the example Periodic Statment 2.#ms.182.0
u,If a lender will put a partial payment in a suspense account, why can't the lender apply as much of the partial payment as is needed to bring a late payment up-to date.#ms.182.1
u,To hold funds in the suspense account until the full amount is collected and fees are paid still hurts the borrower who is at least trying to catch up.#ms.182.2
u,Even paying interest and then the remainder to pricipal on a partial payment helps the borrower catch up.#ms.182.3
u,The lender will benefit from the additional interest on the principal that is paid down more slowly and the late charges.#ms.182.4
u,Otherwise, the suspense account should at least pay interest on the funds equal to the interest on the loan so the borrower is not simply out until he or she can catch up completely while still amassing late charges and additional interest.#ms.182.5
u,The portion of the funds that would be alloted to the escrow for taxes and insurance should be applied as well.#ms.182.6
u,Those items must be paid anyway#ms.182.7
u,and there is no reason for the bank to add them to the loan amount and charge interest when there was funds to cover them.#ms.182.8
u,Perhaps that should be done first.#ms.182.9
u,If adding the breakdown of the escrow payment,as suggested by versability, it might be more informative to show escrow monies received and paid out in the period.#ms.184.0
n,When there is an escrow for multiple types of payments - insurance, taxes etc - the regulation requires "aggregate" accounting that saves consumers money by using a cash flow method.#ms.184.1
n,Also, an escrow disclosure is mailed annually that shows the complete breakdown of the escrow account.#ms.184.2
u,Yes I do think the timeframes are more realistic.#ms.188.0
u,Not really.#ms.188.1
u,The servicer can still invoke any number of vague claims that thwart the borrower from getting information.#ms.188.2
u,I think the extensive list of reasons why a servicer does not have to answer will be used repeatedly.#ms.188.3
u,Not in the normal course of business can be invoked on every request, delaying an answer on the first try every time.#ms.188.4
u,The servicers can and will use any weapon that the CFPB hands them.#ms.188.5
e,I am not a lawyer,#ms.188.6
u,but I see huge holes in these rules.#ms.188.7
u,There's too much emphasis on making sure the servicers are accomodated, at the expense of the borrower.#ms.188.8
u,Calling a servicer does not mean you will get an honest answer.#ms.188.9
u,The assumption is the servicer is honest so the rules are proposed this way.#ms.188.10
u,Taking away the borrowers only legal means to force a servicer to cooperate is not consumer protection.#ms.188.11
u,Please think about this before weakening the consumer's position.#ms.188.12
u,but when you become a victim of a predatory servicer, you start to understand that they will do harm intentionally, as policy, and have no fear of being held accountable.#ms.188.13
e,The problem with paperwork was that they never told us what we were supposed to sign#ms.193.0
e,and they made us send everything in at least 4 times.#ms.193.1
e,Then when we got it all sent in they informed us that they did not hold the  mortgage#ms.193.2
e,but it was held by another holding company.#ms.193.3
e,Then they said that they were allowed to have the mortgage set at approximately 31% of our income#ms.193.4
e,and they are supposedly lower then that#ms.193.5
e,so there was nothing they could or would do.#ms.193.6
e,They kept giving us a run around and playing telephone tag.#ms.193.7
e,But they would not call back when you called them.#ms.193.8
e,It just seems that since we make about $90,000 a year we are just stuck with the payments since we want to keep the house we have to go without so we can make the payments.#ms.193.9
e,I have read all the previous comments#ms.195.0
u,and I agree with some and disagree with others.#ms.195.1
u,I agree that if your lender is not helping you, then you should be able to turn them into someone that can get you some help.#ms.195.2
u,Enter the CFPB, they are here to help the consumer#ms.195.3
u,and that is what they should do.#ms.195.4
u,I disagree with the Lender not being able to force place insurance on a home.#ms.195.5
u,Yes, the deed is in the homeowner's name,#ms.195.6
u,but if the home burns to the ground because the homeowner didn't pay the insurance, what them.#ms.195.7
u,Is the bank just supposed to forgive the debt and take just the land,#ms.195.8
u,because that is all that would be left.#ms.195.9
u,I am pretty sure this is to payoff your mortgage in case of a fire, etc.#ms.195.10
u,and the lender is only supposed to place enough insurance on the loan to cover payoff.#ms.195.11
u,If lenders are not following the rules report them to CFPB,#ms.195.12
u,but understand the more burden that is put on the banking industry the more costly loans are going to become.#ms.195.13
u,Be careful what you wish for.#ms.195.14
e,I never did see or receive the 'Consumer Adjustable Mortgage Rate Handbook'.#ms.197.0
u,Unless borrowers are required to tape record every conversation, I fear oral communications only adds miscommunication and could lead to possible deceptive practices.#ms.199.0
e,For example, prior to my foreclosure calling the title co. only four original loan pages could be retrieved to my loan.#ms.199.1
e,Both the local and corporate offices couldn't find documents to my loan.#ms.199.2
e,It wasn't until after foreclosure did I learn to contact the department of insurance to file a complaint.#ms.199.3
e,It was then did I receive some specific loan documents requested.#ms.199.4
e,I later thought to ask how pages related to the loan application are transferred between the broker, loan originator, and title.#ms.199.5
e,I called title and was told that the only pages kept on file are per the lenders instructions and that they do not keep copies of loan applications on file.#ms.199.6
u,This was unfortunate to hear#ms.199.7
e,since that was not my question and title had already previously sent me copies of those pages.#ms.199.8
u,The example may not be directly related to servicers#ms.199.9
u,but it was meant to demonstrate how a simple inquiring question could raise new questions as to whether the oral experience was a miscommunication or a deceptive practice.#ms.199.10
u,Unfortunately, I do not recommend this.#ms.199.11
e,My intentions upon taking out the loan and putting down 20% was to avoid having to pay a pmi.#ms.201.0
e,I had no knowledge that a lpmi policy was in place on my loan.#ms.201.1
n,USC Title 12 Chapter 49 Homeowners protection sec 4905 states the required disclosure of a lpmi prior to closing the loan as it could cause a higher interest rate.#ms.201.2
n,But the statutory damages under sec 4907 set a maximum of $2,000 in damages.#ms.201.3
u,The costs of the action and attorney fees don't promote any lawful deterrence.#ms.201.4
e,The servicer wrote after my own discovery that no premiums were add to the loan.#ms.201.5
u,Why don't we use a simple, divided insurance formula,#ms.202.0
u,that solves all the force placed insurance problems.#ms.202.1
u,The home owner picks the best insurance policy prior to the closing when purchasing a home.#ms.202.2
u,The policy is divided by responsibility.#ms.202.3
u,The bank adds the portion for the structure to the monthly house payment, that includes wind if required and flood if in flood zone and any inside flooding.#ms.202.4
u,The home owner is responsible for personal injury, appliances and personal effects and has to send in the money directly.#ms.202.5
u,If the home owner quits making the payment it is irrelevant to the bank that is responsible for sending in the insurance on the structure if they want it protected their investment until foreclosure.#ms.202.6
u,It is considered part of the house payment and the bank is returned to arms length with insurance companies.#ms.202.7
u,The insurance can't adjust more than once every 12 months.#ms.202.8
u,The insurance company has to give the home owner 60 days written notice if there will be an increase in the rate on the homeowner or on the banks side.#ms.202.9
u,This way, the homeowner has time to shop for a better rate, before the policy runs out.#ms.202.10
u,The homeowner has the option to replace the banks side and the homeowners side#ms.202.11
u,because it is in their payment.#ms.202.12
u,The closing agent collects a 6 month reserve at the closing for the bank structure insurance.#ms.202.13
u,If the home owner does not make the payment the the bank forecloses.#ms.202.14
u,That is if the bank has not committed massive fraud or destroyed the documents.#ms.202.15
u,If this is the case, then the bank should have to make the structure payment for years, to teach them a lesson.#ms.202.16
u,The only solution is to take away the decision making involving insurance from the bank, as the honesty and ethics problem, prevent any other alternative.#ms.202.17
u,Oh, when determining the value placed on the home for insuring, it is very important to subtract the value of the land from the purchase price for structure insurance.#ms.202.18
u,The land isn't going anywhere.#ms.202.19
e,JP Morgan was servicing my loan for Fannie Mae.#ms.202.20
e,I was shocked to learn after my short sale that I was billed almost  $16,000.00 for one month of force placed insurance.#ms.202.21
e,I was paying State Farm less than $300.00 per month for insurance.#ms.202.22
u,Is this RACKETEERING FOLKS or what!!!#ms.202.23
e,JP Morgan billed me under "escrow shortage" on their payoff provided to the closing agent.#ms.202.24
e,The closing agent also collected on the HUD 1 for insurance itemized.#ms.202.25
e,JP Morgan then collected the 11 month prorated refund for unused insurance.#ms.202.26
e,I complained to the SEC about how much I was charged, by my JP Morgan Fannie Mae combo.#ms.202.27
e,JP Morgan really shocked me then, they tried to justify their outrageous bill and sent me a copy of another force placed annual policy they placed on my home 2 months after my house sold.#ms.202.28
e,They even back dated the policy to start at my closing date.#ms.202.29
e,This explains why my account was left open for 6 months after my house sold with activity in my account.#ms.202.30
u,I guess if Fannie Mae can go to the government and ask for 100 billion and get it when ever they want, then their is a massive incentive to run this bill up, not down, if they are sharing in the proceeds.#ms.202.31
u,I can't think of any other alternatives as hard as I try.#ms.202.32
u,Just let the bank protect the structure that's all they do anyway's, most of the time.#ms.202.33
u,No more pay to play, no more back dated insurance, no more over priced insurance where consumers are taken advantage of at the lowest point in their lives, no changing insurance companies after foreclosure is initiated.#ms.202.34
u,By switching servicers every few months to generate prorated refunds on prepaid annual policies is a very BIG PROBLEM#ms.202.35
u,The insurance company can't change after foreclosure is initiated from the homeowners choice#ms.202.36
u,and the policy stays with the note and mortgage until the property sells.#ms.202.37
e,My friend had three force placed insurance policies in place with over lapping dates after his foreclosure started with each one including the "successors and assigns".#ms.202.38
e,The loan was moved around real fast to generate policies.#ms.202.39
u,We need a rule here to prevent this.#ms.202.40
u,No moving a loan for servicing after foreclosure begins.#ms.202.41
u,A standard monthly statements for banks should be set up to allow bank investigators to go into the bank and run a report and identify most problems if the software is set up for maximum use.#ms.204.0
u,This asking the banks to tell us what they are doing wrong so they can be punished is not working.#ms.204.1
u,Letting the banks pick a friend to investigate them is also a bad option and is slowing our progress.#ms.204.2
u,This is causing the entire country to loose hope and faith.#ms.204.3
u,It is up to bank investigators to do the investigating#ms.204.4
u,and it needs to be easy and efficient using today's technology if we are going to make any progress from this melt down.#ms.204.5
u,Please put all the problems on a flow chart and all the solutions on the chart.#ms.204.6
u,Get who ever wrote the software for ancestry.com or Ebay or US Customs that is amazing to write a linked program that solves all the problems.#ms.204.7
u,Original land records should be put on the computer for public viewing#ms.204.8
u,and the original documents should be stores at an SEC Edgar type location until paid in full.#ms.204.9
u,No more changing or disappearing documents.#ms.204.10
u,The solutions are easy.#ms.204.11
u,Most problems only have one good solution.#ms.204.12
u,Neither party in a Real Estate transaction should be able to hold the original documents for obvious reasons and their is only one solution.#ms.204.13
u,Take the documents away.#ms.204.14
u,No more robo signing, no more missing documents, no more altered documents.#ms.204.15
u,How easy was that to solve three of the worst problems with just take the documents away from the problem.#ms.204.16
u,the answer is both and they should be one in the same.:-#ms.210.0
u,It is easier to trace a relative that dies a 100 years ago on ancestry.com then it is to trace a $500,00 current note and mortgage.#ms.210.1
u,lack of linked cutting edge computer software is the difference.#ms.210.2
u,It is even easie to trace a $1.00 used item sold on Ebay after the sale then a current note and mortgage.#ms.210.3
u,I felt like pulling my hair out trying to put together a chain of title with my note and mortgage.#ms.210.4
u,If an investigator went into US customs they could pull up, on the computer, any container arriving in the USA, where it came from, where it went and what was in it.#ms.210.5
u,Because US customes has current standard technology and an amazing detailed code system that could be adapted for banking.#ms.210.6
u,If you want to see the extent of their success go to panjiva.com and you will be blown away.#ms.210.7
u,Pay the$100.00 and join for one month.#ms.210.8
u,You will then be in search of US Customs program writers to solve most of your problems.#ms.210.9
u,The banks could use this same system to print a standard monthly report for an individual or company account and maximize transparency for investigators.#ms.210.10
u,The same system should accomplish both problems just like US Customs has been doing for a long time .#ms.210.11
e,Example, JP Morgan was charging my loan for drive by inspections after my house sold in a short sale.#ms.210.12
u,So, I know they were not doing the drive by inspections.#ms.210.13
u,The inspector should be able to go into the bank, punch in the drive by inspection code and compare paid out code to billed to customers for drive by inspections with out asking a question and walk out with a report and know to the dollar how bad the problem is in 2 minutes. And ask for proof of payment.#ms.210.14
u,It is important to put all the bank problems on a flow chart first and list all problems and possible solutions .#ms.210.15
u,Include all the questions that customers and investigators#ms.210.16
u,can't get an answer for and then meet with the best program writer.#ms.210.17
u,To pick one issue, without a comprehensive plan, that solves all computer problems, that need a solution, is a recipe for disaster.#ms.210.18
u,The CFPB should have a report on how many times they have been asked the same question.#ms.210.19
u,Financial disclosures! Loan applications must be present an accounted for.#ms.212.0
u,Dates and time of process with signature.#ms.212.1
u,Borrowers should not go home with copies having no signatures or dates.#ms.212.2
u,Large bold type high risk warnings to certain types of loans.#ms.212.3
u,Any and all federal and state required forms or brochures from pre-approvals to the closing of the loan.#ms.212.4
u,Contact resources to any and every department that has oversight or jurisdiction over lending.#ms.212.5
u,Any other disputed rights. Should forever be monitored, addressed, and updated by the CFPB for the borrowers to access and review.#ms.212.6
u,That question becomes complicated as it falls under Real-Estate, business, Corporate laws.#ms.212.7
u,But I also don't believe borrowers are making unreasonable requests.#ms.212.8
u,Oh, yes!#ms.212.9
u,I haven't found any describe disclosure list under current lending laws that borrowers can cross check with their own loan pages.#ms.212.10
u,But there many examples of lending forms shown over the internet.#ms.212.11
e,For example, I'm looking for a form called the 1008 Transmittal Summary.#ms.212.12
e,The vice president of title said they don't know what that form is but will call when they find it.#ms.212.13
e,That was over a year ago.#ms.212.14
e,My last letter from the servicer wrote back.#ms.212.15
n,Pursuant to 12 USC 2605 sec, the information that may be obtained on a loan under a QWR is specifically limited to information relating to the servicing of such loan... includes a statement of the reasons for the belief of the borrower, to the extent applicable, that the account is in error or provides sufficient detail to the servicer regarding other information sought by the borrower.#ms.212.16
e,I challenged the "other information sought by the borrower" trying to gain access to original documents in relation to my loan.#ms.212.17
e,My servicer says they do not intend to waive their rights to other various documents sought by the borrower.#ms.212.18
u,So, access to original loan approval documents are impossible to access since the loan originator is no longer in business.#ms.212.19
u,Consumers finding themselves financially strapped in these predatory or deceptive practices can not become overnight legal experts on law#ms.212.20
u,and they can not afford lawsuits or subpoenas when trying to simply request disclosures related to their loans.#ms.212.21
e,I've contacted and filed a complaint with every office in this country and wound up with a response stating, " Thank you for informing us but there's nothing we can do. Go find a lawyer."#ms.216.0
u,Moderator I can show you documents where the account number has been changed on things like over lapping force placed insurance policies for example.#ms.219.0
u,When loans change hands to generate expenses you see this.#ms.219.1
u,I am saying your "periodic statement" should have the same originating lender code followed by the account number that was assigned at closing on every statement.#ms.219.2
u,The lender code is important, in case the loan transfers to a bank that already has the same number.#ms.219.3
u,There should be a government place to "report an error" if your account number has been altered or changed.#ms.219.4
u,As you seem genuinely interested in this project I would like to send you my case#ms.219.5
u,and you will see  that there are so many issues that need fixing relating to the big picture.#ms.219.6
u,Why fix a few things when you can fix them all.#ms.219.7
u,It's time for national standards#ms.219.8
u,as there is not enough staff to investigate individual banks on every corner with a different system in each one.#ms.219.9
u,Without a system like this investigating the banks will remain impossible#ms.219.10
u,and the problems will change instead of improve as new rules are implemented.#ms.219.11
u,I know this has nothing to do with the subject at hand.#ms.219.12
u,But, I wish that the Cornell University Law School would get involved and figure out why the Supreme Court won't shut down MERS as it is a national problem and the courts are ruling differently in each state, making solving the banking problems worse.#ms.219.13
u,Maybe Cornell can change banking like the students changed Egypt! :-#ms.219.14
u,Not only do they claim that they have no affiliation with the originator and that they only purchased the servicing rights.#ms.222.0
u,After the borrower from frustration gives up and enters into default the servicer just calls themselves a debt collector.#ms.222.1
u,The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act does seem to provide added protection for borrowers.#ms.233.0
u,But I'm concerned when the servicer becomes a debt collector.#ms.233.1
e,At the time I wasn't in default my servicer already classed itself as a debt collector. As shown in this video.#ms.233.2
u,By becoming a debt collector doesn't this allow the servicer to decide which and at what time the laws are applicable to them.#ms.233.3
e,The servicer stated over the phone that it was their policy to deny online access and not provide statements to anyone with a bankruptcy discharge unless the loan is reaffirmed.#ms.236.0
e,I just recieved a response to my direct complaint to the servicer.#ms.236.1
e,They state in writing "Please be advised that our records indicate that your account has gone through a bankruptcy that has been discharged.#ms.236.2
e,Please know that because of the discharge bankrptcy we will no longer send billing statements unless we receive an affirmation agreement.#ms.236.3
e,If you have any questions please contact our bankruptcy department"#ms.236.4
u,As you can see they are trying to use the statements as leverage to obtain a reaffirmation.#ms.236.5
u,I'd go so far as to call it blackmail.#ms.236.6
u,They IMPLY that it is because of bankruptcy laws, and that is what they have TOLD others on the complaint blogs.#ms.236.7
u,But because I have proven it is not a violation against the bankruptcy code,#ms.236.8
u,then this is simply a mean-spirited internal policy the servicer uses to abuse those who have gone through bankruptcy.#ms.236.9
u,Here is your opportunity to stand up for the borrower and make the servicer rescind it's abusive policy.#ms.236.10
u,Require Servicers to provide periodic statements to ALL borrowers including loans discharged in bankruptcy.#ms.236.11
u,It is not a violation of the Bankruptcy Code, in fact this is clearly addressed as it pertains to creditors and principal residences of the debtors.#ms.236.12
u,Another case in point.#ms.240.0
u,The only way to get them to move toward assisting is to hire an attorney to sue.#ms.240.1
e,We did that with our last home.#ms.241.0
e,Our loan was eventually sold to Countrywide.#ms.241.1
e,We had no say in the matter.#ms.241.2
u,OK!  Everyone of us has similar problems and are trying to do the right thing.#ms.242.0
u,When does the government "bail" us out.#ms.242.1
u,The banks already have theirs.#ms.242.2
u,Let's organize.#ms.242.3
u,Now is the time.#ms.242.4
u,An election is coming!#ms.242.5
u,All banks are required to give you a simple form when you apply for the loan.#ms.243.0
u,It states that the bank will sell your loan, the bank will service your loan and does not intend to sell your loan, or the bank can sell your loan.#ms.243.1
u,If you don't want your loan sold, tell them.#ms.243.2
u,If they will not change, go somewhere else.#ms.243.3
u,You did have a say when you signed that form.#ms.243.4
u,Do away with coupon books.#ms.244.0
u,They allow for shoddy service and harmful practices.#ms.244.1
e,For 30 months I used a coupon book to pay my mortgage with BoA.#ms.244.2
e,Consequently, I could not see how my payments were allocated and how the principal was affected.#ms.244.3
e,My new servicer, by contrast, sends a monthly statement that details payment allocation and principal balance as of previous statement.#ms.244.4
e,To compare allocations between old and new servicer, I requested a payment history  from the old servicer.#ms.244.5
e,Lo and behold, I discovered that BoA, did not account for $3700and of my payment amounts over the 30-month preiod.#ms.244.6
e,Since February 2012 I have been trying to get an explanation.#ms.244.7
e,All I have gotten to date from bank representatives is: "Forget about the printed record; trust us, payments were allocated correctly."#ms.244.8
u,Contacting the CFPB has been no help.#ms.244.9
u,As a sole complainant, it seems that I am not worth the bother.#ms.244.10
u,Yet, if this happened to me, conceivably it could happen to anyone who makes payment with a coupon book.#ms.244.11
u,* For most small to mid-size lenders the actual statements are outsourced to a third party due to the cost of creating something in house.#ms.245.0
u,Therefore the ability to change the format of a statement is not only limited but very expensive.#ms.245.1
u,In a time of ever shrinking margins  this is a cost that just cannot be easily absorbed.#ms.245.2
u,* If the CFPB is going to require changes to a statement they should create a safe harbor format to shield FI's from being sued by lawyers looking to make money and not protect consumers.#ms.245.3
e,As someone who has been in the industry for well over a quarter I can give some insight here.#ms.246.0
u,For a small to midsize lender the mortgages will often be stored on a system that is not connected in real time to your core processing system.#ms.246.1
u,This would prevent someone from being able to view their mortgage on their home banking page.#ms.246.2
u,It's not meant to be secretive#ms.246.3
u,but it is just a fact that different computer systems often do not communicate with each other.#ms.246.4
u,I am against having oral and written requests being treated equally.#ms.246.5
u,Written requests have, by their nature, a more formal stature and create a paper trail.#ms.246.6
u,An oral request will create a "he said, she said" conflict.#ms.246.7
u,and it does include the information we send.#ms.249.0
u,As for safe harbor some other regs specifically state if a FI uses that format they are protected from liability.#ms.249.1
u,The CFPB should do the same.#ms.249.2
u,Having spent so long dealing with vendors I do not anticipate a cost savings.#ms.249.3
u,If anything, I can see a "compliance surcharge" being added.  "#ms.249.4
u,A rule is not a rule once you start making exceptions.#ms.254.0
u,Ultimately, entities for which the exception was not intended find a way to exploit it.#ms.254.1
u,Moderator, Steve Smith made a great point that is related to insurance and is another example of the narrow scope of the questions, that you have to work with.#ms.257.0
u,Your success level with this program will be based on embracing the issues that are relevant and important that are being ignored, like the point Steve made.#ms.257.1
u,Ultimately, the consumer pays for PMI.#ms.257.2
u,If PMI is required, then the home owner should be able to  shop for the best rate.#ms.257.3
u,If PMI is mandatory then it should be listed and broken down on the statement that we are discussing.#ms.257.4
u,Banks need to be removed from insurance where it appears they commit massive fraud so banks will  return to focusing on loaning money.#ms.257.5
u,The home owner should shop for the PMI best rate to protect their loan because ultimately they are paying for it.#ms.257.6
u,The homeowner should shop for the best price they can find on structure insurance based on replacement value of the structure including wind or hurricane or flood or fire or water damage, on a need basis and subtract the value of the land for replacement insurance.#ms.257.7
u,Structure and PMI insurance is considered part of the monthly house payment just like interest and principle.#ms.257.8
u,This keeps what is mandatory to secure a loan to a minimum so homes will not be lost due to over priced insurance any longer.#ms.257.9
u,Nobody should loose their home because they are paying for optional items either.#ms.257.10
u,There is an easy solution for this.#ms.257.11
u,If the homeowner wants insurance for theft, personal injury or house content then this is handled directly between the homeowner and the insurance company if they can afford it#ms.257.12
u,and it is a separate policy.#ms.257.13
u,Basically moderator, separating minimum priced mandatory bank insurance from optional insurance is crucial and could make the difference from making a house payment or not.#ms.257.14
u,Mandatory insurance should be in the name of the bank and homeowner.#ms.257.15
u,Optional insurance should be in the home owners name and paid directly from the home owner to the insurance company if they can afford optional insurance.#ms.257.16
u,The bank gets a 6 month reserve for structure insurance at closing.#ms.257.17
u,The bank sends in the payment every month for PMI and Structure insurance.#ms.257.18
u,There is never a default on the banks side where it is placed on auto pay monthly.#ms.257.19
u,No more prepaid annual policies to generate prorated refunds by switching servicers.#ms.257.20
u,Even though the banks have this expensive force placed insurance on properties they are not keeping up the properties and selling them as is.#ms.257.21
u,It is important to stop this game, and only allowed structure insurance for the bank.#ms.257.22
u,The most important thing in this paragraph is the importance of separating mandatory insurance, from optional insurance.#ms.257.23
u,It is crucial to get the price of insurance as low as possible to prevent a lot of unnecessary foreclosures.#ms.257.24
u,It's time to remove bank greed and fraud from property insurance.#ms.257.25
u,It's time to return banks to loaning money.#ms.257.26
u,It was time 4 years ago.#ms.257.27
u,I am but one consumer, one data point, and hesitant to extrapolate my experience into public policy proposals.#ms.258.0
u,But ARMs are indeed confusing,#ms.258.1
u,and there is a great variety of types of ARMs.#ms.258.2
u,My experience is that a mortgage servicer will seek to interpret an ARM's language to its greatest benefit.#ms.258.3
u,One way this is done, in my experience, is to incorrectly calculate an interest rate at a change date.#ms.258.4
u,I would be happy to see another error added to better address interest rate disputes,#ms.258.5
u,as this may well be one type of deceptive practice the industry employs.#ms.258.6
u,* The regulation should only apply to banks that sell loans and only on the loans that are sold.#ms.261.0
u,* Almost all new regulations require training for all employees,#ms.261.1
u,which is expensive and unnecessary.#ms.261.2
u,The regulation should always be simple enough that all bankers and consumers can understand it without having to pay someone to understand it.#ms.261.3
u,* All regulations now have a requirement that the regulation has to be audited at least on an annual basis and the findings reported to the board, even if the bank does not have anything to audit or report.#ms.261.4
n,99% of all banks want to comply with all laws and regulations.#ms.261.5
u,It is either the expense involved or the misunderstanding of the reg. that causes them not to be in compliance.#ms.261.6
e,I am required to have three exteral audits done at my bank now.#ms.261.7
u,There is no reason this regulation cannot be short, simple, and easy to comply with.#ms.261.8
u,If you need help with it, call me.#ms.261.9
u,I personally think all banks should keep and service all mortgage loans they make,#ms.261.10
u,but then people that can't afford to buy houses whould not get too.#ms.261.11
u,Moderator, maybe the government could buy one less military plane and fund this program.#ms.262.0
u,The American people are not afraid that Iran or Russia are going to bomb their homes.#ms.262.1
u,The American people are afraid of the banks that are already here, that collapsed the economy and are taking advantage of them now, by inflating the fees and then stealing their homes with fake document by hiring a slimy attorney.#ms.262.2
u,They are living with fear and anxiety#ms.262.3
u,because their chain of title has been destroyed with MERS and the banks are killing their homes values and stable neighborhoods are turning into rental neighborhoods with run down homes deserted with expensive insurance on them to fix them up#ms.262.4
u,but it is not being used, just billed.#ms.262.5
u,This system would be a lot cheaper than a plane and would save a lot more families from destruction.#ms.262.6
u,It is sad, that something as complex as this situation is being handled in such a fragmented way with little progress in 4 years.#ms.262.7
u,The most important advise I can ever give you for all your questions is the need to start with a flow chart of all the problems and possible solutions.#ms.262.8
u,The fact that this has never been done is appalling!#ms.262.9
u,Please have a department at your school take this project on even if nobody asks except for me.#ms.262.10
u,I can fill up your chart.#ms.262.11
u,You have to really know what the problems are in there entirety before the correct solution can even be found.#ms.262.12
u,Any thing else is just putting the cart before the horse.#ms.262.13
u,Process of elimination after viewing the entire problem will always lead to the best solution.#ms.262.14
u,There needs to be a second chart from the flow chart that shows which government agency is responsible for implementing the solutions.#ms.262.15
u,Next, these government agencies need to meet monthly by video conference and present their progress and their goals for the following month.#ms.262.16
u,You know the accountability thing.#ms.262.17
u,We don't have a good system for investigating the banks is the main problem.#ms.262.18
u,This is what lead to your limited questions in the first place and the reason we are emailing each other.#ms.262.19
u,An employee insider that has experienced one of these bank investigations left an interesting blog on your site that explains their process first hand.#ms.262.20
e,I have not even begun to tell you everything that happened to me.#ms.262.21
u,Your questions are too narrow to address most of the issues my case exposes that need addressing.#ms.262.22
u,Steve you have posted an excellent example of how people continue to get the run around.#ms.266.0
u,One of the reasons the servicers or debt collectors seem to not care is because really they are not obligated to the borrower.#ms.266.1
n,The servicer has a contract and a fiduciary duty to the INVESTOR.#ms.266.2
n,The borrower is an account the servicer manages on the behalf of the INVESTOR.#ms.266.3
u,So "customer service" really is a misnomer,#ms.266.4
u,they do not view us as customers.#ms.266.5
u,They view us as accounts.#ms.266.6
n,The servicer does not have a fiduciary duty to the borrower,#ms.266.7
u,so they really do not care about anything except the revenue the account  provide.#ms.266.8
u,The caveat is that the INVESTOR wants the account to keep paying,#ms.266.9
u,but the system is designed to bring more revenue to the servicer if the borrower is late or in default.#ms.266.10
u,So getting the servicer to provide information about the INVESTOR is like pulling teeth.#ms.266.11
u,The servicers guard this information because they do not want the borrower to tell the INVESTOR what is going on...#ms.266.12
u,The wording does not get it right.#ms.268.0
e,When our family went through this, the people representing the lender told us:#ms.268.1
e,don't worry about ARM's, you can always refinance later#ms.268.2
e,Of course, once the collapse hit, refinancing became not an option for many.#ms.268.3
u,The wording should specifically say something like: "WARNING: you may not be able to refinance later, so you should expect to have to make the higher rate payments later"#ms.268.4
u,I don't understand how paying an insurance policy for a Non-Escrow loan is so difficult.#ms.270.0
u,You know the process already because you're obviously already doing it for Escrow loans.#ms.270.1
u,I'm not seeing the difficulty in providing the same service to Non-Escrow customers.#ms.270.2
n,The systems are clearly in place by your own admission.#ms.270.3
u,You're just adding more volume, so hire a few more people.#ms.270.4
u,...so hire a few more people.#ms.274.0
u,We operate on a razor thin margin.#ms.274.1
u,If I hired "a few more people" for every regulation I would lose money and no longer be in business.#ms.274.2
u,A credit union is a not for profit enterprise but it cannot lose money and remain in business.#ms.274.3
n,Second, while a data base is in place for escrow accounts no such system exists for non-escrow accounts.#ms.274.4
u,Go back and read my post.#ms.274.5
u,Once insurance is force placed things go downhill very quickly and the chance of my getting paid back is slim to none.#ms.274.6
u,Even if I could find out who to pay I am not going to misuse the credit union's funds to pay for additional riders on a homeowner's policy.#ms.274.7
u,Here is a real world example which will illustrate why this proposed rule is unfair.#ms.276.0
e,I am a mortgage originator and loan servicer.#ms.276.1
e,I hold all the loans I make.#ms.276.2
e,I have a customer who has stopped making payments on his account.#ms.276.3
e,He is 6 months past due on his loan and has refused to make contact with us.#ms.276.4
e,He is in foreclosure.#ms.276.5
e,I escrow for his taxes and his insurance.#ms.276.6
e,He has a large shortage in his escrow account.#ms.276.7
e,His homeowner's renewal is due on October 23, 2012.#ms.276.8
e,The renewal premium is $1,398.00.#ms.276.9
e,The proposed rule would require that I pay his insurance premium from his escrow account#ms.276.10
e,even though he does not have enough money in his escrow account to cover the premium.#ms.276.11
e,I can write forced placed insurance to cover my interest in his property for $460.#ms.276.12
e,Yes, the insurance is inadequate for his needs,#ms.276.13
e,but it is perfectly adequate for my needs.#ms.276.14
u,The steps I have taken seem perfectly fair and reasonable.#ms.276.15
u,This proposed rule implies that even if the borrower has stopped paying the loan, I as the mortgage holder and loan servicer have a responsibility to protect the borrower, no matter how much money it will cost me.#ms.276.16
u,In today's world it could take years to finally take back a property.#ms.276.17
u,This rule would require me to pay the borrower's policy premium for 2, 3 or even 4 years, even though I could protect my interest in his property for 1 or 3 the cost.#ms.276.18
u,Of course, at any time, the borrower can call the insurance agent, cancel the policy and receive the refund, a refund of my money, not his.#ms.276.19
u,Asking me to pay his premium monthly instead of yearly is a ridiculous alternative, in my estimation.#ms.276.20
u,The borrower is being unfairly enriched at the expense of the mortgage holder.#ms.276.21
u,This is not the way the our American system is designed to function.#ms.276.22
u,I know that the public is angry and wants to make Wells Fargo and Bank of America pay for everything, as retribution for the mortgage meltdown.#ms.276.23
u,But small mortgage holders like myself are being forced to pay for the sins of others.#ms.276.24
u,The rule is unfair to me and is simply wrong, based upon how our American system of economics functions.#ms.276.25
u,I strongly recommend that the CFPB rethink its rule and implement a new rule which requires the mortgage servicer to inform the borrower of the situation and give the borrower the opportunity to take responsibility for himself, as I have outlined above.#ms.276.26
u,Your arguments make no sense.#ms.279.0
n,As an expert in the loan tracking industry, I can 100% indisputably tell you that there is no extra cost whatsoever to treating a non-escrow and an escrow loan the same.#ms.279.1
u,You're flat out lying,#ms.279.2
u,and I have to call you out.#ms.279.3
e,I've worked in every loan tracking system,#ms.279.4
u,and if you'd like to contact me for a free consultation on your credit union's loan servicing software, simply do a google search for Versability or "The Boy Who Cried Force Placed Insurance"#ms.279.5
u,and I'd be more than happy to consult your supposed Credit Union on how to accomplish this at absolutely no cost.#ms.279.6
u,Otherwise I'd thank you to stop lying in this forum,#ms.279.7
u,because I know better and I WILL call out your lies.#ms.279.8
u,If you are, then you're self insuring, and you're actually not serving your own needs" since you'd be the one paying out the insurance.#ms.280.0
u,That makes no sense.#ms.280.1
u,2 99.99% of the time it has been proven beyond any shadow of any doubt that the force placed policies are overpriced and unnecessary.#ms.280.2
u,You're going to be paying the premium one way or the other.#ms.280.3
u,If you want to call the insurance company to cancel some of the coverages or add the insurance cost to the borrower's loan, that's the purpose of an escrow account,#ms.280.4
u,and if they default, you're insured against that by the investor.#ms.280.5
u,Once again, your real world example holds no water.#ms.280.6
u,3 in every case, it is always cheaper and better for everyone involved to have the preferred voluntary policy continued rather than placing a force-placed policy.#ms.280.7
u,You're not being forced out of anything.#ms.280.8
u,....and so ends any attempt at civility.#ms.281.0
u,Really, there is no need to lob "three score barrels of powder" at me.#ms.281.1
u,These rules will be tough on a small lending firm.#ms.284.0
u,The consumer needs to take responsibility for his actions.#ms.284.1
u,There are just too many regulations.#ms.284.2
u,Although some of these regulations are burdensome, email notification and communication is paramount in this age.#ms.285.0
u,My servicer does not allow me to communicate via email which makes record keeping difficult for me - unilateral for them since the conversations are recorded.#ms.285.1
u,To maintain clear information that will prevent people from being  "overwhelmed" with fraud would require the bank to give the home owner a choice of servicers at closing. Just like when you buy a computer you pick your service provider.#ms.293.0
u,For a servicer to change 4 times in a year, to create multiple annual forceplaced insurance policies, is abuse!#ms.293.1
u,Your servicing should not be traded like a stock because, well it's stupid, leads to fraud and leads to people being "overwhelmed" for no reason.#ms.293.2
u,When you buy a car you decide who is going to send you your monthly bill.#ms.293.3
u,The banks have proven they are way too irresponsible to make this decision for homeowners.#ms.293.4
u,It is important that if a house has gone into foreclosure that the payoff information remains the responsibility of the lender not the attorney taking care of the foreclosure.#ms.294.0
e,This is very important because I got a payoff from both the servicer and the attorney to see what would happen, in Florida.#ms.294.1
e,There was close to  a $10,000.00 difference in payoff statements.#ms.294.2
e,The attorney overstated the payoff in almost every category that he gave to the closing agent.#ms.294.3
e,I have proof.#ms.294.4
u,The servicer still needs to provide service and be held accountable for the accuracy.#ms.294.5
n,The FBI has determined that Florida is one of the worst states for mortgage fraud and with over 90,000 attorneys in Florida the Florida bar revokes very close to "0" licenses.#ms.294.6
u,So, leaving an attorney responsible for payoffs is a risk that is not necessary to take#ms.294.7
u,and I don't think it should be allowed.#ms.294.8
u,Moderator, I think the list of reasons that the servicer does not have to respond is open for abuse and continual stalling.#ms.307.0
u,Most information that consumers ask for or need are just a few keystrokes away for the servicer,#ms.307.1
u,but they make it difficult if not impossible for consumers to access that information.#ms.307.2
u,I hope the new rules will bring relief to homeowners,#ms.307.3
u,but right now the servicers have no real obligations or duties to the homeowners.#ms.307.4
u,The entire mortgage servicing system is flawed from the start.#ms.307.5
u,I appreciate the financial difficulties small servicers may face.#ms.308.0
u,However there are options e.g. subservicing,  which can lower cost, improve service and comply with the proposed regulations.#ms.308.1
u,If customer service is the goal then the size of servicer should not be a criteria as there are small servicers that do not provide adequate service.#ms.308.2
u,A single point of contact needs to be as described; and needs to be cross-trained to provide real and accurate answers.#ms.317.0
u,If an answer is not available, the SPOC needs to follow up with the client in a reasonable time to provide an answer to their questions.#ms.317.1
u,Often times clients are assigned to a SPOC that is unable to assist them, and does not have accurate updates.#ms.317.2
u,Another problem is that often times even though a SPOC exists, other account reps from various departments at the same servicer  continue to contact or send letters to the client which confuses them as to which documents have been received, what needs to be provided, and what the status is.#ms.317.3
e,For example, a client was approved for a trial mod#ms.317.4
e,but after signing and returning her documents, she received a notice from another department stating that she needed to provide documents for an approval.#ms.317.5
e,Then when she called that department the account manager said they didn't receive the documents that she had signed and overnighted to them, and had no notes regarding the approval.#ms.317.6
e,At that time I told her to contact her POC  and verify that everything had been received and approved...#ms.317.7
e,it had.#ms.317.8
u,It was an internal error which caused more stress on the client,#ms.317.9
e,and I have witnessed it happening many times to many clients.#ms.317.10
u,I don't have time to address each category individually, so I want to make a plea here for common sense!#ms.319.0
u,While there may be legitimate reasons for delays or missing information, oftentimes obfuscation and complicating tactics mean there are things they don't want you to know, or they hope you will just go away.#ms.319.1
u,This happens in many industries--health insurance is a good one.#ms.319.2
u,If the government's job is to facilitate commerce, and also prevent fraud, both could be served by simply requiring mortgage businesses to behave transparently.#ms.319.3
u,It's the old Golden Rule applied to business!#ms.319.4
u,If they won't agree they should have a legitimate explanation or be denied the opportunity.#ms.319.5
u,I agree that would be lovely.. for the people who are just now having these issues,#ms.320.0
e,what about people like my husband and I who had multiple circumstances causing financial issues,#ms.320.1
e,we request a loan mod. and the lender and attorney we hired said the lender will not even begin to negoiate with us until we where behind on our mortgage, something we where not.#ms.320.2
e,Long story short i have the proof they said it all documents covering my hiney and I am 1 year out of short sale and started the whole this in 2007 and due to all the NON-Contact and screwup's we just finalized it Sept, 2011#ms.320.3
e,our credit was perfect before and after only the one problem due to bad legal advice.#ms.320.4
e,We are now trying to buy a home and cannot get a loan with less than 6.7% for 20 years and we have 700 credit scores, with 20% down not to mention everything we paid off and no minimual credit cards.#ms.320.5
e,I have gone to 3 banks ,#ms.320.6
e,Im told to get a good rate it has to be 2 years and i already have one gone.#ms.320.7
e,They wont even consider the extenuating circumstances.#ms.320.8
e,25 years in law enforcement and perm disability guarnteed income and still have to wait 1 year.#ms.320.9
u,I need to find a company that does better than the others,#ms.320.10
u,its a no brainer we  are  a great investment.#ms.320.11
u,Pass on any help you can i need it.#ms.320.12
e,Also I have stacks of documents showing they lost my paperwork ,#ms.321.0
e,some comments are , they cannot find it ,#ms.321.1
e,then its been given to collections,#ms.321.2
u,which there was no reason for that,#ms.321.3
e,then every other time they would misplace "lose" my documents, then switch peole and they loose it.#ms.321.4
e,I have the conversations where the realtor and the rep at the bank tell each other they lost my stuff ,#ms.321.5
e,also the documentation and notes from the attorney we paid to "help" us they marked down man times that there is a hold up do to misplaced papers#ms.321.6
u,What do you do when all you wanted was a loan modification and Chase would not discuss or negoiate with us until we where behind in our payments, and the attorney we hired to help us told us we had to stop making payment before they could do anything#ms.322.0
u,And i still cant find a decent interest rate.#ms.322.1
e,6.75% for 20 years just because i have 1 year left.#ms.322.2
u,My credit is perfect besides that#ms.322.3
u,Someone help me!#ms.322.4
u,Yes, I think it is feasible to expect servicers to make the accommodation of having a SPOC for ALL outbound and inbound communications with clients and housing counselors, AND that they are able to answer questions , and have direct contact with underwriters .#ms.325.0
u,It would be ideal if housing counselors were able to have direct communication with underwriters and eliminate the third person in between which would also be more cost effective due to a reduction in communication problems, time, and the amount of re-dos because of inaccurate rejection issues.#ms.325.1
u,I agree Britt,#ms.327.0
u,This information belongs to the consumer.#ms.327.1
u,Forcing a querant into discovery is unfair, expensive and very often a lengthy process.#ms.327.2
u,The burden should NOT be on the consumer to retrieve ALL information in their mortgage file.#ms.327.3
u,To do less not only harms the consumer it harms the public records.#ms.327.4
u,Stop negotiating with these banks,#ms.327.5
u,force the banks to organize their records and reconcile them with the registries.#ms.327.6
u,ENOUGH ALREADY.#ms.327.7
u,I disagree with the "send it back to the borrower" idea.#ms.335.0
u,This does not make sense and does not benefit the borrower.#ms.335.1
u,This will only incur late fees to the benefit of the servicers.#ms.335.2
u,The borrower should be able to send payments to the old servicer up to 60 days after the transfer date without fear that the payment will not be applied.#ms.335.3
u,The borrower should only be concerned with making the payment on time.#ms.335.4
u,The old and new servicer are already in a contractual agreement, so tranferring the payment from the old servicer to the new servicer is a simple electronic transaction.#ms.335.5
n,It is applied on the same day the old servicer recieves the payment from the borrower.#ms.335.6
u,So this talk about sending payments back to the borrower is detrimental to the borrower,#ms.335.7
u,this is against the entire purpose of the CFPB protecting the borrower.#ms.335.8
u,Do not send payments back to the borrower!#ms.335.9
u,The old and new servicer shall implement policies and procedures to ensure the payment is posted correctly by either servicer.#ms.335.10
u,Here is another force placed insurance problem that is not being addressed with the current force placed insurance solution.#ms.337.0
u,The current solution, which is a "warning" to the borrower that will some how prevent force placed insurance.#ms.337.1
u,Because the homeowner can not make their property insurance payment, because of lack of funds, the bank is going to highly inflate the insurance, is some how the current solution.#ms.337.2
u,This makes the problem worse and is not a solution but another problem.#ms.337.3
u,I have linked the following problem because I'm surprised this problem is not all over the web.#ms.337.4
u,I would guess this ladies problem was probably created because the banks collapsed the market after running the market up with artificial demand leaving her upside down.#ms.337.5
e,This lady's house is now worth $59,000.#ms.337.6
e,Her insurance company will only insure the house for $59,000.#ms.337.7
e,She owes $84,000 on the house.#ms.337.8
u,Her insurance company will not insure her home for  more than it is worth.#ms.337.9
e,So her lender put a force placed insurance policy on her for $84,000 instead of the difference is her complaint,#ms.337.10
u,however her complaint should be about a lot more probably.#ms.337.11
u,This is so sad, and needs a solution.#ms.337.12
u,This board needs Transparency and Versability because we will tell them what they have wrong and right based on personal experience.#ms.337.13
u,Please do not tell me "0".#ms.337.14
u,I love Elizabeth Warren and the CFPB#ms.337.15
u,and I want this program to be hugely successful,#ms.337.16
u,because it is our only hope, for bank reform and is the only reason that I am sending you some of my suggestions that fall under the scope of your questions.#ms.337.17
u,24 CFR 3500.17 should be amended to explicitly prohibit collection of an amount greater than that needed to pay taxes and insurance.#ms.339.0
u,CHASE is demanding that the impound account balance equal a MINIMUM of the amounts needeed PLUS a two month impound#ms.339.1
u,account cushion AT ALL TIMES.#ms.339.2
u,This equates to an interest free loan to the servicer for the life of the loan.#ms.339.3
u,AND CHASE THREATENED TO FORECLOSE after admitting the money was not needed to pay the impounds.#ms.339.4
u,This is extortion.#ms.339.5
e,I would be happy to share my lenghthy correspondence with Chase over this.  I then refinanced.#ms.339.6
e,FAILURE TO PAY IMPOUND EXPENSES:  A prior lender, Bank of America let my homeowners' insurance lapse -- despite collecting the money, and my forwarding 3 notices that the insurance would be, and then was being cancelled for non-payment.#ms.339.7
e,After it was cancelled, B of A said that I would have to pay to reinstate,#ms.339.8
e,and they would eventually reimburse me.#ms.339.9
u,There needs to be a penalty for EVERY TIME this occurs.#ms.339.10
e,I refinanced.#ms.339.11
u,I am concerned about underwriters being overwhelmed by calls from clients and understand how difficult it is to constantly be interrupted while trying to review detailed information...#ms.341.0
u,however; the reps also interrupt the underwriters to find out information for clients and counselors#ms.341.1
u,so it wastes time adding a 3rd person to the mix when the information at hand is critical to the decision making process.#ms.341.2
u,I don't think the average turn around time for evaluation decisions is accurate.#ms.341.3
u,so they are able to accurately complete the evaluation.#ms.341.4
u,Instead, clients must re-apply from the beginning which wastes time that could be spent on new client applications, and prolongs the foreclosure process.#ms.341.5
u,My suggestion would be for clients to have a SPOC for both inbound and outbound communication, and for the housing counselors to have direct contact with underwriters with the understanding that housing counselors will be contacted for any needed information or decisions BEFORE client files are closed in order to avoid declines based upon missing information, misunderstandings, or the reasons stated previously.#ms.341.6
u,In response to the EXCLUSIONS mentioned in  and the process of UPDATING BORROWERS, I recommend it to be updated as so...#ms.343.0
n,In any event, where the servicing of a mortgage is transferred, sold, assigned, and or or other from the original mortgagee that will change ANY information pertaining to the payments of a consumer loan, the servicer must provide the "Updating Borrower" letter regardless of how the servicing is contracted.#ms.343.1
u,It shall be the responsibility of the mortgagee that DECIDES TO SELL THE SERVICING RIGHTS, to create a documented trail of the transaction that is visible to consumers and provide ANY or ALL methods available to the consumer that ensures all payments are directed to the appropriate department, company, contractor, affiliate and or or other that will provide services on the behalf of the original mortgagee.#ms.343.2
u,My point is simple,#ms.343.3
u,lenders DECIDE to sell the service, to who or why is irrelevant,#ms.343.4
u,what is important is that they must retain some form of record that creates a paper trail that can be followed by any competent individual, especially the mortgagor.#ms.343.5
u,In response, the CFPB is surely on the right track#ms.344.0
u,and I understand that added stress on the company,#ms.344.1
u,but as much is added to the consumer.#ms.344.2
u,As mentioned in the TIME FRAME allocated to such a transfer, 15 days in my eyes is short and should be at least 30-45 days.#ms.344.3
u,Why, simple...most mortgagor's pay their mortgages "Once every month",#ms.344.4
u,so what is happening is that the burden of making an adjustment in 15 days is left to the mortgagor#ms.344.5
u,which is unreasonable.#ms.344.6
u,As a mortgagor, I would "ALWAYS INVESTIGATE" any or all changes to who recieves my payments,#ms.344.7
u,and 15 days is just not sufficient.#ms.344.8
u,So, to RESOLVE the issue, extend the NOTICE TIME to 30and days,#ms.344.9
u,and should the mortgagor continue to make the payment to the OLD servicer,#ms.344.10
u,PICK UP THE PHONE#ms.344.11
u,AND MAKE CONTACT WITH YOUR CLIENT, AS YOU HAVE PROFITTED FROM HIS or HER PAYMENTS.#ms.344.12
u,In addition, a letter explaining that any future payments MUST be made to the NEW servicing company to avoid additonal penalties being assessed to your account...basically 2 letters and a phone call to those that didnt get it or do NOT understand.#ms.344.13
u,Periodic Statements... unless you want to get paid "Peridocially" you should send consumers  "MONTHLY STATEMENTS"...therefore collecting your payment every time you send a statement.#ms.345.0
u,We are talking about MORTGAGES, if not the largest, surely one of the largest investments consumers will make#ms.345.1
u,and we see how connected it is to our global economy,#ms.345.2
u,as soon as the little guy is NOT making payments, the world practically collapses.#ms.345.3
u,It is vital, to not only mortgages, but to any business...#ms.345.4
u,you should always maintain a connection with your clients to ensure your relationship is one of good standing that will continue for many years to come.#ms.345.5
u,As to the ITEMIZATION, I find it surprising that NOT all servicers provide this detail of consumers accounts.#ms.345.6
u,If the servicer does not know about the itemization and current standing of the consumers account, well then they need to apply some sort of system that allows them to maintain these records...#ms.345.7
u,asking the consumer to pay for it, is just ridiculous.#ms.345.8
u,This is similar as to asking a local community, to pay for the construction, permits, taxes, infastructure and other costs to open a McDonalds on the corner.#ms.345.9
u,Yes, I might like thier burgers,#ms.345.10
u,Yes it might be convenient right down the street,#ms.345.11
u,When the government required fast foods to contain a nutrition label, I didnt get a call from McDonalds saying, since you eat here, we need to charge you X so that I can continue to accept your business.#ms.345.12
u,The burden of being compliant is always on the one providing the services or products in exchange for profits.#ms.345.13
u,In response to Info...it should be the standard practice to all businesses...#ms.346.0
u,the better informed your client is , the better your relationship or the better chances of you  getting paid.#ms.346.1
n,As described in the FRAUD ACT 2006... Fraud by failing to disclose information.#ms.346.2
n,A person is in breach of this section if he-#ms.346.3
n,adishonestly fails to disclose to another person information which he is under a legal duty to disclose, and .#ms.346.4
n,bintends, by failing to disclose the information- .#ms.346.5
n,ito make a gain for himself or another, or .#ms.346.6
n,iito cause loss to another or to expose another to a risk of loss.#ms.346.7
n,Simply said, it is considered FRAUD to not provide "INFO".#ms.346.8
u,If your collecting payments for the next 30 years , info associated with the account it is surely part of the business obligation.#ms.346.9
u,To close, if at any point, your client  is at risk of NOT making payments, it surely becomes your DUTY to protect the contract by offering solutions...#ms.346.10
u,or in this case "Info".#ms.346.11
u,WHEN...is surely tough when crediting an account when payments are inconsistant and completely understand the complexity of the matter when providing up to date information to the client in a timely manner .#ms.347.0
u,As I feel there is NO one answer that conforms to ALL needs...I feel what is important is creating an incentive that encourages MOST people to act, ultimatelty streamlining most of whatever process.#ms.347.1
n,In the past, consumers where offered discounts on the mtg interest  if you signed up for electronic payments.#ms.347.2
u,Though this may or may not be an option now, the idea is to add options, not take away...#ms.347.3
u,as they say in the service business, different strokes for different folks.#ms.347.4
u,And that should be up to company and or or its affiliates.#ms.347.5
u,Surely a tough situation for both ends.#ms.347.6
u,HOW...like mentioned by "versability, August 12, 2012 4:54 pm" the OPTION to be paperless is up to the client .#ms.347.7
u,I would add though, it is to often that computers become UNRELIABLE therefore making paperless accounting very risky.#ms.347.8
u,I know that saving trees is extremely important, but buyer beware with anything electronic.#ms.347.9
n,In todays age, an area that works along side with an electronic system is identity theft and viruses.#ms.347.10
u,It is just as improtant, should you decide to go paperless, make sure you print a RECEIPT...because the burden of proof is on the consumer, not the organization!#ms.347.11
u,I understand the lender or servicer's fears that the integrity or independence of a review may be compromised by the coaching of clients by their underwriters;#ms.348.0
u,however, that is not what I was implying,#ms.348.1
u,and I doubt it would be an issue as the underwriters are working for the servicers, not the clients;#ms.348.2
u,so underwriters would have no incentive to coach clients.#ms.348.3
u,What I was implying was for underwriters to follow up and ask questions or confirm obvious small mistakes that are made before simply denying a modification.#ms.348.4
u,Yes, in a perfect world housing counselors would catch all errors,#ms.348.5
u,but aside from the fact that we are also human and miss things from time to time ourselves, and that every servicer has slightly different requirements; often times clients submit paperwork before seeking the aid of a housing counselor#ms.348.6
u,so we are coming in during the middle of the process.#ms.348.7
u,2 examples of avoidable denials based upon obvious errors which could have been corrected...#ms.348.8
u,A client was denied due to an obvious miscalculation in the expense column of her RMA;#ms.348.9
u,another client was denied because although she wrote a detailed explanation of her hardship, she did not check the hardship box.#ms.348.10
u,I believe the transferring servicer should not be allowed to contact the borrower subsequent to the transfer date for any reason.#ms.349.0
u,If contact is necessary such as to follow up on an NSF the new servicer should be required to make the contact on behalf of the old servicer.#ms.349.1
u,Any requests to borrower to send another payment, for example, should come from the new servicer#ms.349.2
u,and funds should be sent to the new servicer.#ms.349.3
u,This will ensure that the borrower will not get caught up in a dispute between services.#ms.349.4
u,This issue really should be a part of the fair lending or  consumer protection practices...#ms.351.0
u,Consumers should have access to their information whenever they need it.#ms.351.1
u,Ultimately it should be up to clients if they want to receive periodic statements in the mail; would rather have them emailed; or want neither, but are able to request a statement when it is needed.#ms.351.2
u,There are plenty of primative inexpensive software programs available to small businesses.#ms.351.3
u,Small servicers should not be exempt from sending periodic statements if the client requests them, but should be allowed to solicit their clients for waivers or alternatives to save money.#ms.351.4
u,Because of your lack of education on the ACTS that now govern and control how YOU or YOUR ORGANIZATION works with consumers, let it be a "DEMO" of what happens with you make exceptions.#ms.355.0
u,Based on the SAFE ACT...I will say, maybe a long shot...but, you are NOT a LICENSED MLO, maybe just registered...#ms.355.1
n,and if an executive of the bank, you did not even submit a background check or credit report.#ms.355.2
u,Again, amazing...how can one guy looking at a different screen have different data...#ms.358.0
u,thats impossible!#ms.358.1
n,As a fairly tech savy person and experinced programmer, though my screen may be designed differently, with different buttons or colors, it DOES NOT affect data.#ms.358.2
n,The DATA is consistent regardless of computer or screen or access...#ms.358.3
u,it just might be aranged differently,#ms.358.4
u,or maybe certain information is not showing because you might not have clearance.#ms.358.5
n,Fine, okay...but one guy has 8 payments on your account#ms.358.6
n,and the other guy has 36 payments on your account,#ms.358.7
u,this is just unimaginable!#ms.358.8
u,This is just unrealistic to the purpose of maintaining data.#ms.358.9
u,Simple solution, if you have a DATABASE and are considering a servicer or subservicer or whatever...create a restricted and secure access point to only specific information for this contractor so that the information is consistant on your screen aswell as on the contractors screen#ms.358.10
u,you see this now with almost everything, credit card companies, power companies, almost anyone that has adopted "payonline" options, has these access points for account holders#ms.358.11
u,...again, I cant believe this is even a problem!#ms.358.12
u,Surely push "Good information management" through, its a no brainer.#ms.358.13
u,I agree Britt.#ms.360.0
u,I believe the intent of the consumer is to retrieve all internal comments .#ms.360.1
u,All of this information belongs to the consumer.#ms.360.2
u,Oral testimony mean zip, zilch, nothing in the context of servicer abuse.#ms.360.3
u,Less than zero.#ms.360.4
u,I am going to have to disagree with mpick76.#ms.363.0
n,Banks use depositers money to lend.#ms.363.1
n,In addition, files that qualify for sale on the secondary markets are sold in order to create liquidity...#ms.363.2
n,therefore, now they have the cash to lend again.#ms.363.3
n,Banks charge FEES  to create the loan, plus collect a premium on the sale of the loan due to the projected value over the next 30 years of payment.#ms.363.4
u,ALL banks or lenders need to be held to the same REGS regardless of size,#ms.363.5
u,and if you have anyone handeling loans, they should conform to the SAFE act#ms.363.6
n,which right now, BANKS  are not, because thier LOAN OFFICERS are NOT required to TESTED.#ms.363.7
u,It is impossible for anyone to know the LAW unless your obligated to comply.#ms.363.8
u,I can only say one name...Washington Mutual.#ms.363.9
u,They were one of the largest contributors to this nightmare,#ms.363.10
u,and they were a BANK .#ms.363.11
u,Problem: Every place where there is not transparency in lending there is fraud.#ms.365.0
u,Solution: All account activity directly and indirectly in your account has to be on the monthly statement addressing companies by name not category.#ms.365.1
u,Problem: "depending on circumstances"#ms.365.2
u,Solution: No, ALL circumstances#ms.365.3
u,Problem: "The servicer would not have to respond to requests that come more than 1 year after the loan is paid off.#ms.366.0
u,Solution: No time limit to expose mortgage abuse.#ms.366.1
u,Problem: Allowing servicers to charge for information on your account.#ms.366.2
u,Solution: All monthly account activity directly and indirectly needs to be transparent on the monthly loan statement,#ms.366.3
n,this is not an alicart restaurant.#ms.366.4
u,This should not be an issue if the homeowner had escrow for insurance.#ms.5.0
u,The Servicer should pay the original insurer.#ms.5.1
u,Notice should be sent to the homeowner that the policy was paid on every anniversary with the name of the insurance company.#ms.5.2
e,We have submitted 5 complaints to the New York State Banking Dept. of homeowners who received forced placed insurance that was 5 times more than the policy on record.#ms.5.3
n,When a servicing transfer is done, insurance information is rarely transferred alongside the mortgage information, despite the fact that it is often the same Insurance Tracker that acts as both Loan Servicers.#ms.15.0
n,Because of this, many borrowers are saddled with false placement of Force-Placed Insurance.#ms.15.1
u,Escrow accounts have entirely too many unexplained fees.#ms.21.0
u,Loan Servicers should be forced to explain every fee on an escrow account on a monthly basis so borrowers are made aware of what they are being charged and why.#ms.21.1
u,Also the Loan Servicer should not be allowed to create an escrow account for borrowers with a non-escrow loan without explaining why.#ms.21.2
u,In addition, a negative escrow account created by insurance  should not interfere with a borrower's ability to pay their property taxes via escrow.#ms.21.3
u,The tax balance and insurance balance should be kept separate to prevent the borrower from being pushed into foreclosure for nonpayment of taxes due to the Loan Servicer's erroneous placement of Force-Placed Insurance.#ms.21.4
e,I've registered as a consumer#ms.33.0
e,but to be clear I'm an attorney who has done real estate closings#ms.33.1
u,though it was never a practice area.#ms.33.2
u,Further, my comments that follow are admittedly not directly on point for this section but of the section choices this seemed the closest to my concern.#ms.33.3
e,Two weeks ago I closed my own mortgage refinancing simply to get a much better interest rate.#ms.33.4
e,The closing documents totaled 127 pages, exclusive of the title report and home appraisal.#ms.33.5
e,The closing documents required approximately thirty signatures, and initials on almost every remaining page.#ms.33.6
u,So much of the information was repetative.#ms.33.7
e,My closing took an hour and a half and I  understood what I was doing.#ms.33.8
u,If I was representing someone, particularly the buyer, who wanted each document explained, the closing process would have been much longer.#ms.33.9
u,This is information overload and unnecessarily, in my opinion, complicates the process and dilutes comprehension.#ms.33.10
n,Now, in my case, I recognized that not all these documents were required by regulation for consumer protection.#ms.33.11
u,Nevertheless, a simple home mortgage refinancing should not require 127 pages to protect all parties with an interest in the transaction.#ms.33.12
u,In giving the banks 5-45 business days to respond to information requests, I am left to assume that the CFPB has been watching too much Mad Men and is attempting to regulate a bank in 1960.#ms.52.0
u,If I were to use my debit card to make a 2purchase anywhere in the world, it will show pending on my account instantly.#ms.52.1
u,Let's say I'm really behind the times and I write a check.#ms.52.2
u,That check will clear the instant it is scanned by anything attached to the internet.#ms.52.3
u,We are no longer living in the checking times described by Tom Hanks' character in Catch Me If You Can.#ms.52.4
n,There's not a 10 day delay in a check clearing because it has to be mailed through central depositories and to corporate offices, etc.#ms.52.5
n,The banks who made this process instantaneous are the same ones servicing our mortgages .Now.#ms.52.6
u,No matter who you have an account with, whether it's a bank or credit union, large or small, it doesn't matter...#ms.52.7
u,Walk into a branch and ask for account information.#ms.52.8
n,That representative will immediately pull your information up and tell you what you need to know.#ms.52.9
n,If there's a discrepancy and you're arguing with them, they'll even turn their monitor around and show you what they're looking at right then and there.#ms.52.10
n,If you ask for anything in writing, they will hand it to you.#ms.52.11
n,If you ask for a screenprint, they will provide it.#ms.52.12
n,The line at the bank today still moves faster than it did in your grandparent's day.#ms.52.13
n,You mean to tell me it's an instantaneous process to deduct a check card transaction from the balance of my Arizona-based account for a $10 purchase I made in China,#ms.52.14
u,Somebody please explain to me how that's considered acceptable in any way.#ms.52.15
u,No matter what it is, you can figure out how everything in the world works, is made, etc...except in the financial and insurance industries.#ms.52.16
u,1. This rule only works if there are requirements to notify on denials, with harsh penalties for failure to send notice of a denial timely, including loss of right of forclosure for a proscribed period#ms.62.0
u,and that the clock would not start until person was sucessfully contacted via certified signature required mail.#ms.62.1
u,2. Servicer denies appeals as a rubber stamp of their own actions.#ms.62.2
u,Does nothing.#ms.62.3
u,Should be requires that all LMO's have an appeals process, if one is offered.#ms.62.4
u,3. Borrowers Rejections must have ample time to evaluate the situation 48 hour decision windows, on real estate transactions like your primary residence should not be allowed.#ms.62.5
u,4. This should also have an appeal window.#ms.62.6
u,Absolutely critical to construct this culture and structure of support for accurate and continual exchange of information with THE main affected party: at-risk owner.#ms.68.0
u,I would propose that the Owner have access to the full checklist of documents that he or she must satisfy for the completion of the process in question, and see the same documents that the service can see.#ms.68.1
u,Hearing someone tell you over the phone that they can't find a document that you delivered over and over again is about the most frustrating and alienating and helpless shady experience I had while trying to short sale my home.#ms.68.2
u,My continual and repeated efforts where futile and inefficient.#ms.68.3
e,At the beginning of our struggle all we wanted was to convert our option ARM loan to a 30 year fixed at a lower interest.#ms.76.0
e,Our calls were ignored for months and we were transferred to one person after another,#ms.76.1
e,each time we had to begin again with our explanation and information!#ms.76.2
e,When at last we had to get another loan to avoid the continuing financial slide, Countrywide sends us e-mails telling us what a good customer we were and offering us a 30 year fixed rate.#ms.76.3
u,Too little...too late.#ms.76.4
u,This should not be allowed!#ms.76.5
u,How...you've given a concrete stance w or  absolutely no statistics to back it up.#ms.100.0
u,I've given well thought out and detailed arguments for why everything should be treated evenly.#ms.100.1
u,Right now your proposed rules for Avoiding Foreclosure presume every foreclosure is lawful, which is absurd.#ms.126.0
u,Unlike the national foreclosure fraud settlement, your proposals do not address wrongful foreclosures.#ms.126.1
n,However, even though the national foreclosure fraud suit alleges deceptive practices in wrongful foreclosures,#ms.126.2
u,the administration of the settlement will not stop them.#ms.126.3
u,Your proposed rules for "Avoiding Foreclosure" need to add a provision to stop an unlawful foreclosure in progress#ms.126.4
u,and you need to enforce the national foreclosure fraud settlement#ms.126.5
u,because the state attorneys general have no intention of doing so.#ms.126.6
n,Page 27 of the multistate complaint, which is posted on nationalmortgagesettlement.com brought by the state attorneys general, the DOJ and other regulators specifically names the deceptive practices used by banks to take homes they have no right to foreclose on,#ms.126.7
u,and, by identifying these violations as deceptive practices, acknowledge these acts are under the purview of state attorneys general and the CFPB.#ms.126.8
u,The state attorneys general having brought suit over Wrongful Conduct Related to Foreclosures, but now will not investigate it or stop it, so it is up to the CFPB.#ms.126.9
u,* None of the state attorneys general offices or the CFPB will investigate and stop in progress the deceptive practices described beginning on page 27 of the lawsuit.#ms.126.10
n,* None of the state attorneys general offices or the CFPB have a consumer complaint form on their website which seeks information about violations of the deceptive practices described beginning on page 27 of the lawsuit.#ms.126.11
u,* None of the state attorneys general offices or the CFPB will acknowledge over the phone they have the authority to investigate and stop in progress the deceptive practices described beginning on page 27 of the lawsuit.#ms.126.12
u,Would the CFPB propose a rule for Avoiding Foreclosure that will help with at least the following:#ms.126.13
u,Stop wrongful foreclosures based on deceptive practices in progress.Justice will not happen on its own.#ms.126.14
u,We could use some help.#ms.126.15
u,Since the new servicer is essentially the 'buyer' of the right to service the mortgage why does this proposed rule not require full disclosure of all information provided by the prior servicer within a reasonable period of time.#ms.139.0
u,It seems to me that by acquiring those servicing rights the servicer should also have responsibilities regarding completion and accuracy of information transfer from 'old' to 'new' servicers.#ms.139.1
u,With full disclosure to the borrower of the information obtained from the previous servicer within 30 days.#ms.139.2
u,This should enhance transparency by making this all available to the borrower in this process.#ms.139.3
u,The key to stopping foreclosures is to stop overpricing housing.#ms.158.0
u,The effects of a bubble economy are simply to onerous.#ms.158.1
u,The problem is that the real estate industry has resisted and whittled down all attempts to limit those mortgages containing a government guarantee.#ms.158.2
n,The underlying economic value of a home in the economy by the top 30% wage earners should be used as a basis for cutting off government mortgage subsidies#ms.158.3
n,Part of this is the mortgage home deduction.#ms.158.4
u,There should be a maximum value this deduction based on the maximum earning capacity of the 70th percentile.#ms.158.5
u,this would be in many markets in the $200K to $300K size.#ms.158.6
u,Mortgages should not be guaranteed above this amount.#ms.158.7
u,So if a $700K mortgage was originated only $300K would be tax deductible#ms.158.8
u,and only $300k mortgage would be government guaranteed,#ms.158.9
u,the other $400k would be guaranteed by the lending institution.#ms.158.10
u,This would also apply to tax free income from sales of homes.#ms.158.11
u,Those homes that sell over $300K would not be eligible above $300K for the gains.#ms.158.12
u,So if a home sold for $400K then the 100K would be taxable.#ms.158.13
u,What I mean by the 70th percentile is traditional formulaes say 1 or 3 of income to service debt.#ms.158.14
n,That means that when interest rates rise these values change also.#ms.158.15
u,No I recognize these values are arbitrary so 70th percentile could be 80th,#ms.158.16
u,but not 98th and 1 or 3 income could be .40 of income.#ms.158.17
u,And that increased interest rates could be averaged to minimize economic forces.#ms.158.18
u,However overall we need to discourage bubbles through our taxation and guarantee policies.#ms.158.19
u,That's easy, existing laws.#ms.164.0
u,The financial industry already decided on which borrowers should receive a LMO for their own financial protection, the homeowners who if foreclosed on would cost the investor to lose a guaranteed portion of their initial investment proven by a andNPV.#ms.164.1
n,ANY HOMEOWNER WITH A LOAN TO VALUE ABOVE 80%  WOULD COST THE INVESTOR TO LOSE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT, A POSTIVE NET PRESENT VALUE REGARDLESS OF THE HOMEOWNERS PERSONAL FINANCIAL STATUS#ms.164.2
n,Since no other branch of the govermnent has enforced existing laws,#ms.164.3
u,it is up to the CFPB, which was in my proposal to the government in the fall of 2008, to get the "fox out of the henhosue".#ms.164.4
n,It is in direct violation of the law when two homeowners with the same negative equity  DO NOT RECEIVE the same consistent similar financial incentive to remain a negative equity homeowner#ms.164.5
u,following is a partial list of the violations occurring : unfair, deceptive and abusive business practices,misrepresentation that modifications are about affordability when a andNPV is required, the reasonable reliance that Main Street has that the government and Wall Street would act in good faith and fair dealings or the fact that every time a homeowner is denied a negative equity modification for his or hers social economic status being put at a financial disadvantage discrimation occurs.#ms.164.6
u,a partial list of business, tort and civil violations occurring on a daily basis#ms.164.7
u,Wall Street will not change their ways as long as there are NO PENALTIES THAT ARE ENFORCED#ms.164.8
u,since most homeowners do not have the financial whereitall to sue and the banks have the governments blessing and taxpayers money to do whatever they want,#ms.164.9
n,there are no penalities to them.#ms.164.10
u,AND MOST IMPORTANT UNTIL THE TAXPAYER PAID ENTITIES OF THE GSE'S AND THE FHA ARE INCLUDED INTO STANDARD CAPITALISTIC LMO'S, OF A MODIFICATION FOR EVERY NEGATIVE EQUITY HOMEOWNER,#ms.164.11
n,The solution has been given to all seven governmental agencies back in the fall of 2008.#ms.164.12
u,The proof is in the pudding so to speak,#ms.164.13
n,the OCC, and the AG's have included PARTIAL numerous guidelines from my proposal, UNITEDINPROSPERITY.ORG to stop the Foreclosure Crisis from continuing, such as single point of contact, dual tracking, staffing, time limits, communications, standards etcc..#ms.164.14
n,BUT all without including the underlying principle that housing is a capitalist product not a socialistic one.#ms.164.15
u,The mortgage clause of "dont pay be foreclosed on" was changed to "let me modify you if you have negative equity, not if you can't afford it"#ms.164.16
u,Because of the governments actions and inactions and the lenght of time past,#ms.164.17
u,it is crucial that the solution be enforced NOW not in another 6-9-12-15-18-21 months.#ms.164.18
u,I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with any member of government at their convenience.#ms.164.19
u,A check list of disclosures and rights to legal disclosures should be required at every closing on the front page.#ms.200.0
u,A borrower shouldn't have to hire a third party or search over the internet to discover what legal disclosures they are entitled to.#ms.200.1
e,Prior to my foreclosure, a third party  was hired to send out a QWR;#ms.200.2
e,it consisted of six pages sent certified on 4-19-2009 requesting documents to which I never would have known I had any rights to.#ms.200.3
e,The servicer replied on 08-10-2009 to the third party and never CC any copy over to me.#ms.200.4
e,When the third party sent me a copy, the letter stated that the servicer responded enclosing the Adjustable Rate Note and Mortgage#ms.200.5
e,but the remaining request were internal business records and did not need to be furnished under RESPA 12 USC section 2506 .#ms.200.6
e,The third party in my opinion knew what to ask for.#ms.200.7
u,Consumers aren't provided with legal disclosures rights nor do they have any means or instructions to find out.#ms.200.8
u,Why further place any more restrictions.#ms.200.9
e,The servicer in the same response letter stated that they had nothing to do with the loans origination and that they were not affiliated with the original lender.#ms.200.10
e,The servicer included a contact address and phone number to where the loan originator could be reached.#ms.200.11
e,When trying to contact the original lender, the phone was disconnected and a letter was returned labeled rejected.#ms.200.12
e,What I found out later at the Security Exchange Commission website was the bankruptcy purchase agreement between the loan servicer and my bankrupt loan originator.#ms.200.13
e,It described my servicer purchased the loan originators servicing rights, business assets, and the actual building to the contact address they provided to me in letter.#ms.200.14
u,1. There is a great need for a third party service since consumers are limited on knowledge.#ms.200.15
e,2. Notice the four months it took for the servicer to respond.#ms.200.16
e,3. I did not receive an account history until after foreclosure, and after filing a complaint with Department of Corporations.#ms.200.17
e,4. I don't see how a servicer who purchases servicing rights, the building, and assets can inform a consumer to contact a defunct originator in which they know is no longer present.#ms.200.18
u,The joke was on me and the servicer had to be aware of it.#ms.200.19
u,I do not see any points in protecting servicers if their designed intent is to stall, collect, and use deceptive practices that further damage consumer rights.#ms.200.20
u,Deceptive practices restrict consumers from being able to afford litigation when facing foreclosures.#ms.200.21
u,I do not think the CFPB should be equating any such leniency for servicers.#ms.200.22
u,The 4 letter original lender code followed by a dash then loan number needs to be on the closing documents.#ms.203.0
u,It is important that this combo can not be altered for the life of the loan.#ms.203.1
n,If I punch in on line for example BOFA-123756327 then I should be able to pull up a chain of title linked to property records, leins, taxes etc.#ms.203.2
u,We have had the technology for so long.#ms.203.3
u,The worst problem is that people can't defend themselves in court with out a chain of title and banks are adding additional force placed insurance policies by altering the loan number on the policies so they are hard to trace.#ms.203.4
u,Make it simple,#ms.203.5
u,we have the technology.#ms.203.6
u,This way the banks will have to clean up their behavior#ms.203.7
u,because they will not have a choice.#ms.203.8
e,We purchased a home in CA in 2005 via Country Wide with an adjustable rate interest.#ms.223.0
e,We also took out a 2nd with Citi.#ms.223.1
e,Citi purchased our first from Country Wide.#ms.223.2
e,We are currently 40% underwater.#ms.223.3
e,We worked with NACA and waited 5 months to be approved for a lower fixed interest rate on our 1st two years ago.#ms.223.4
e,We fell behind on our 1st due to multiple health related issues .#ms.223.5
e,We jumped through hoops with Citi for 5-6 months, again, via NACA regarding the 1st.#ms.223.6
e,We stopped making payments in Jan 2012 due to the lack of income during the injuries and in order to persuade them to work with us.#ms.223.7
e,They resently sold our 1st to Carrington, after telling us that we made too much money to qualify for any type of loan modifiation .#ms.223.8
e,Meanwhile, we put the majority of our house payment money in a savings account.#ms.223.9
e,Citi via NACA refused to negotiate with us on our 2nd.#ms.223.10
e,Now Carrington is telling us that we qualify for a FHA 30 year fixed rate mortgage  6.50% and that they will pay off the 2nd#ms.223.11
e,Citi now is willing to take only $7,000 for a $95,000  7.75%.#ms.223.12
e,We are both still employed,#ms.223.13
e,but we are facing some possible lay offs due to Sequestration in Jan 2013 and will have a large increase in our Health Insurance, beginning Oct. 1st, via the employer, along with furlough days.#ms.223.14
e,More furlough days may be on the way after the November 2012 elections .#ms.223.15
e,We are working with NACA to see if we qualify for the HAMP,#ms.223.16
e,but they do not think we will qualify based upon our income, right now.#ms.223.17
e,We physically have recovered, for the most part, from our injuries and have some current pending litigation which will take years to settle.#ms.223.18
e,Carrington and First Alliance Bank are very, very interested in us pursuing the refinance option as opposed waiting for the results of the HAMP determination .#ms.223.19
e,I am not in such a hurry to follow through with the refinancing until I hear about the decision regarding the HAMP.#ms.223.20
e,We now have credit scores of 630 and 650 instead of 730 and 720 .#ms.223.21
u,A 6.50 interest rate sounds very high#ms.223.22
e,and we are current with all of our creditors.#ms.223.23
u,It does make sense to provide statements  to discharged borrowers who continue to pay the mortgage.#ms.265.0
u,I agree that some may no longer want statements, perhaps because they are walking away.#ms.265.1
u,But those who filed bankruptcy in order to save thier homes should be allowed to request and receive statements and online access to properly manage the accout.#ms.265.2
n,The proposed rule requires that the mortgage servicer continue to pay the homeowner's insurance   from the escrow account even if the customer is in default on the loan.#ms.271.0
u,This places an undue burden on the mortgage servicer.#ms.271.1
n,It is often the case that forced placed insurance is much cheaper than the cost of a full blown HO Ins policy, particularly with small balance loans where the servicer only needs to protect its interest in the property, not the full value of the loan.#ms.271.2
u,If a customer is in default and has not made payment for many months , the home owner is being unduly enriched and the mortgage servicer is being harmed by having to payout much more than it otherwise would have to to protect its interest in the property.#ms.271.3
u,The commentary suggests that the mortgage servicer pay the HO Ins premium monthly to avoid having the customer cancel the policy and run off with the funds.#ms.271.4
u,I strongly believe that this is an untenable situation for the loan servicer, which now has 12X the amount of work to do.#ms.271.5
u,Consumers need protections,#ms.271.6
u,but enough is enough.#ms.271.7
u,If a consumer stops paying their loan, the servicer should be free to place forced fire insurance.#ms.271.8
u,The real question is the definition of default.#ms.271.9
u,1 or 2 months behind is clearly not enough.#ms.271.10
u,But if a consumer hasn't made a payment for 6 months, the servicer should be free to inform the cutsomer that it no longer will escrow for HO Ins.#ms.271.11
u,The consumer can then look for their own insurance.#ms.271.12
u,If they get it, great.#ms.271.13
u,If not, then the lender can place forced insurance.#ms.271.14
u,Once the lender stops escrowing for HO Ins, it must rerun its escrow analysis to make sure a refund is not due back to the consumer.#ms.271.15
u,However, let's be honest, with 6 months of missed payment, a refund will never be due.#ms.271.16
u,I believe this is a very reasonable resolution to this issue.#ms.271.17
u,The answer to this question needs to be guided by the long history of contract law in America.#ms.277.0
n,If the customer makes his payment after the grace period has expired, then the customer is contractually obligated to pay the late charge.#ms.277.1
u,So the answer is yes, the customer must pay the late charge before the monthly payment is to be considered fully paid.#ms.277.2
u,The CFPB should not be issuing a rule which over-rides a legal contractual obligation of the borrower to the lender.#ms.277.3
u,Excluding the late charge is arbitrary and not based on any solid legal foundation.#ms.277.4
u,It just feels good.#ms.277.5
u,The rule could just as well exclude the principal portion of the payment and include only the past due interest.#ms.277.6
u,Excluding the principal portion is no more arbitrary than excluding the late charge.#ms.277.7
u,Please make rules which are based on the legal contractual obligation between the borrower and the lender, not based upon a feel good approach that views lenders and loan servicers as evil and borrowers as angels that are never in the wrong and  have no responsibilities to live up to.#ms.277.8
u,My comment about email is a more a general one, that it should be a required form of communication due to the prolific use of email at this time.#ms.300.0
u,Not sure of the cost but I imagine that most correspondence is boiler plate.#ms.300.1
n,Sending an email is less expensive than postal mail.#ms.300.2
u,I think our laws lag in this area due to the alleged strain it would put on customer service departments.#ms.300.3
u,In my opinion most organizations have divested in this area and consumers experience huge gaps in this area.#ms.300.4
u,One of the pitfalls for us with "too big to fail" organizations.#ms.300.5
e,I recently refied a mortgage through a small firm in Charlotte, NC.#ms.305.0
e,They informed me that my mortgage would be sold.#ms.305.1
e,During the waiting period, I had to make payments to them and the payments were recorded correctly without any problem.#ms.305.2
e,Approximately 30 days ago, I received a letter from Citi that they bought my mortgage.#ms.305.3
e,The balance stated was wrong as I had made extra principle payments.#ms.305.4
e,I then received a statement from them and the history of the account was totally blank other than one payment.#ms.305.5
e,I have called Citi and talked with Supervisors in their Tuscon office.#ms.305.6
e,I was informed that it was my problem and I should have not made the payments to the Charlotte Company.#ms.305.7
e,It is my understanding from the Citi letter that any payment made before 9 or 1 or 12, the payment was to go to the Charlotte Company.#ms.305.8
e,Looking at my mortgage balance on the Citi website, Citi is showing a mortgage balance of close to $10,000. more than what is owed.#ms.305.9
e,I have even faxed them the history from the Charlotte Company for them to check and review the problem.#ms.305.10
e,Nothing has been done.#ms.305.11
e,No phone calls, no email, no acknowledgement by Citi of the reported problem.#ms.305.12
u,In today's world where banks can post transactions daily, provide ACH transfers, allow high frequency trading, why is it so hard for someone at Citi to pick up the phone and resolve this issue.#ms.305.13
u,The system is broken and the link is that big banks can not perform simple functions.#ms.305.14
u,Not one person is complaining because they have "too much information".#ms.315.0
u,The public is pulling their hair out because of lack of information, run around and lies.#ms.315.1
u,If all activity in a borrowers loan account is disclosed to the homeowner monthly, their would be no "unduly burdensome" phone calls to the servicer.#ms.315.2
u,Why is the CFPB complicating things further by separating what information only an attorney can get as opposed to what a borrower can get.#ms.315.3
u,Splitting the disclosure up between different companies without a simple monthly transparent statement is ignoring the real problem.#ms.315.4
e,I am the poster child for mortgage abuse, having found crime in almost every category, in reference to my home loan.#ms.315.5
u,I can tell you, the only thing that would have prevented this from happening, to me, would be if the  "Transaction Activity" category, in your new sample Periodic Statement  include all activity related to my loan.#ms.315.6
u,Keep in mind this is not a regular bank statement with lots of entries.#ms.315.7
u,This a 1 simple loan statement#ms.315.8
u,and there should only be a few entries under "Transaction Activity" each month with transparency.#ms.315.9
u,For example, if JP Morgan gives Assurant money for a force placed insurance policy and Assurant cuts a check back to JP Morgan or a subsidiary of JP Morgan for 75% of the policy and both activities are related to my loan then the servicer needs to record both under "Transaction Activity".#ms.315.10
u,I can see why the banks would say this is being "unduly burdensome" when they have to document what they are really doing to people.#ms.315.11
u,If the servicer charges for a drive by inspections after your house sold then the company name and phone number need to be in Transaction Activity showing the payout.#ms.315.12
u,If your servicer and the closing agent both collect your current years property taxes at closing, the day it was paid out should show up in your "Transaction Activity" so you can find it.#ms.315.13
u,If the bank is going to keep your account open for 6 months, after your closing, charging you additional interest, to use up some of the over stated closing money, then the bank should send you monthly statements, for 6 months, showing what they are doing behind your back.#ms.315.14
u,Limited disclosure like you are proposing is bad but you should see what happens, after the closing, when no disclosure statement is mailed out and your account is left open.#ms.315.15
u,You don't know the half of it.#ms.315.16
u,Because this entry was not required, on the monthly statement, is the reason so many people, have been so badly abused and why this went unnoticed for so long.#ms.315.17
u,You say the banks claim it is "unduly burdensome" to tell me what they are doing to me.#ms.315.18
u,Let's dissect the banks objections and make some real progress.#ms.315.19
u,Transaction Activity transparency is the category where the problems and solutions rest#ms.315.20
u,and it is being swept under the rug, with your plan, with very little disclosure and you are not hearing the "ORDINARY" people.#ms.315.21
u,Moderator, please get a list from the CFPB of all the "unduly burdensome" issues the bank claims is beyond the roll of "servicing" a loan, that they are afraid to disclose.#ms.315.22
u,Unless someone is being over paid or generating some third party fraud that requires information to be hid, the banks should be happy to put everything on the monthly statement, to relieve the servicer, of the burden of all the phone calls.#ms.315.23
u,The truth is the Banksters know, that they have to put up with, unduly burdensome phone calls#ms.315.24
u,because the only other alternative is to expose their crimes, under "Transaction Activity"#ms.315.25
u,and people will no longer need to call.#ms.315.26
u,With full disclosure, the banks and the CFPB's phone should hardly ring, in reference to mortgage loans.#ms.315.27
u,If you leave this category, the way it is now, you have just enabled the circus to continue.#ms.315.28
u,Bottom line, it is not up to the banks and servicers to determine how responsible they are going to be,#ms.315.29
u,it is up to the government to set the standards high not low, with transparency.#ms.315.30
u,Why will Obama not tell Richard Cordray to demand full disclosure, from the banks, for the "ORDINARY" people, if a bank wants to be able to continue to lend money,#ms.315.31
u,end of story!#ms.315.32
u,If I understand you correctly, you are going to limit even further the information available to the public, making some of it only available to attorney's,#ms.315.33
u,which would allow servicers not to respond to certain types of information requests according to you.#ms.315.34
u,I get real nervous, when you talk about a "new disclosure system by attorneys, rather than ORDINARY people".#ms.315.35
u,What is even more scary is your solution for the question that we are currently discussing that addresses not being able to get information from your lender.#ms.315.36
n,Your solution talks about the CFPB's worry about "the risk of overloading consumers with too much information".#ms.315.37
e,I have been alive for 50 years and nobody in any conversation has ever complained that their lender has given them too much information.#ms.315.38
u,I realize that Adam Levitin, that just joined the CFPB, as an advisor, is an attorney and could benefit from this rule#ms.315.39
u,but after reading some of his amazing papers I would love to know what he has to say about this.#ms.315.40
u,My opinion is, you don't limit borrowers information further to reduce crime and increase transparency.#ms.315.41
u,The ordinary people should not have to pay out any money to get information on your loan#ms.315.42
u,it should be provided monthly.#ms.315.43
n,Look at the earnings of the largest servicers even with all the lawsuits#ms.315.44
u,and you should agree they need to start offering service for their earnings.#ms.315.45
n,A couple of entries a month is hardly a burden for this amount of wealth the banks are generating from the ordinary#ms.315.46
u,and the banks probably cannot even believe they are getting away with providing such little detail.#ms.315.47
u,Borrower Problem: borrowers not given information#ms.315.48
u,Solution: borrowers get all relevant information monthly, timely.#ms.315.49
u,Servicer Problem: unduly burdensome phone calls where answers are few#ms.315.50
u,Solution: Borrower gets all relevant information monthly eliminating unduly burdensome phone calls#ms.315.51
u,Warning a borrower about force placed insurance is irrelevant to addressing the problem, symptom or solution.#ms.318.0
u,After reading your link to 2024.37 force placed insurance 2viii I realized that the only solution that is being offered for all the force placed insurance issues is that the banks have to tell the borrower that they are about to place a force placed hazard insurance policy on them that "cost significantly more".#ms.318.1
u,In other words, if you can't make your property insurance payment, our solution is to increase the price of the insurance.#ms.318.2
u,Providing a borrower a written statement that you are going to take advantage of them is not the solution but part of the problem.#ms.318.3
u,Trust me, after watching 4 years of abuse, the homeowners know they are about to be screwed over,#ms.318.4
u,with over priced insurance, that is going to make their problems much worse, and may prevent the chance of any recovery.#ms.318.5
u,Providing it in writing, mandated by the CFPB  just means that the government approves of this behavior,#ms.318.6
u,which makes the pain even worse.#ms.318.7
u,This is deplorable!#ms.318.8
u,That is like saying, if you don't send in your $100.00 electric bill payment on time, we are going to charge you $500.00 per month for electric instead#ms.318.9
u,and we are going to add a creepy middle man, to share in our electricity scam that "cost significantly more".#ms.318.10
u,The government wants to increase transparency, so I have to give you heads up to the scam in writing.#ms.318.11
u,Problem:homeowner has run into a financial issue and can't make their property insurance payment.#ms.318.12
u,My 2nd provided Solution: Get the insurance payment as low as possible by eliminating all optional coverage#ms.318.13
u,and only insure the structure for the bank at the lowest price possible.#ms.318.14
u,Allow the bank to place this on auto pay monthly and charge the homeowner interest on this amount just like their home loan.#ms.318.15
n,If home is 3.5% interest then 3.5% on the insurance balance paid out monthly on auto pay.#ms.318.16
u,If the combined balance at the bank between principle, interest and property insurance ever equals 3 months behind then foreclosure is an option.#ms.318.17
u,If the bank cannot continue the same policy then they have to find one at the same price or lower.#ms.318.18
u,Remember this policy has a lot less things it covers because the homeowner side is removed#ms.318.19
u,so it actuality  is still considered "significantly more" at the same price because it covers less categories now and nobody has addressed this.#ms.318.20
u,If you kick people when they are down instead of helping them up or just not kicking them and see if they can get up on their own is a better option.#ms.318.21
e,just got a copy of it a couple of months ago.#ms.318.22
u,Multiple policies at the same time that include successors and assigns as obligated parties to the policies.#ms.318.23
e,This is some of the things that happened to me and or my friend.#ms.318.24
n,As shocking as this was, it is even more shocking that  the CFPB just wants banks to notify borrowers that they are about to be kicked them while they are down as a solution.#ms.318.25
u,Trust me all borrowers have friends that have already been kicked#ms.318.26
u,and they don't need a warning because they know what's coming#ms.318.27
u,and this is irrelevant to any solution.#ms.318.28
u,I agree with peekaboo that servicers large and small provide poor service,#ms.336.0
u,and so the size may not be the deciding factor on quality of servicing.#ms.336.1
n,But since there is not fiduciary duty between the borrower and the servicer, the quality of service to the borrower is simply "voluntary" at best.#ms.336.2
u,The servicers have a duty to the Investor, and do not work for the borrower.#ms.336.3
u,So really there should be no exemtions at all, unless a fiduciary duty is imposed there will always be bad behavior and trickey to the detriment of the borrower.#ms.336.4
u,Small servicers may  have a better relationship with the borrowers, but it is not by obligation.#ms.336.5
u,Exceptions are simply loop holes for the opportunity to take advantage of the unsuspecting or uneducated...#ms.352.0
u,this is absolutly out in left field.#ms.352.1
u,in short, equality is vital...big or small...mom and pop vs chains...#ms.352.2
u,the rules need to be the same.#ms.352.3
u,the minute you feel your company is overwhelmed, CREATE A JOB#ms.352.4
u,there are plenty of people that need jobs...#ms.352.5
u,it would be a great time and opportunity to grow your business and take your business to the next level...#ms.352.6
u,get out of your comfort zone.#ms.352.7
u,You might sit and say, "this is alot for little old me with only 1000 files",#ms.352.8
u,but rest assured that the company with hundreds of thousands of files is saying, "holy cow, this is going to cost me millions"...#ms.352.9
u,you are just at a different level.#ms.352.10
u,Equally the same for everyone, big or small.#ms.352.11
u,It is amazing that this is even a topic or option,#ms.357.0
u,of course it should be, or should HAVE been in place.#ms.357.1
u,Where I get lost with this as the mortgagee.#ms.357.2
u,As a mortgagee...MORTGAGEE:#ms.357.3
u,I really do NOT care about your house, I want my money.#ms.357.4
u,Your home is yours, your families nest.#ms.357.5
u,As the mortgagee that extended you the money to purchase your families home, I simply want to make ANY or ALL arrangements possible to collect the money you agreed to for the home you decided was best for you and your family.#ms.357.6
u,We are not in the house business,#ms.357.7
u,we are in the money business...#ms.357.8
u,unfortunatley the money is tied to your home.#ms.357.9
u,The bank DOES NOT want your house...#ms.357.10
u,I promise they dont,#ms.357.11
u,they want money.#ms.357.12
u,Not having a dept or case mgr within a company that will help the company aquire the original reason behind the transaction, is just flagrant.#ms.357.13
u,In a case of asset-based lending, I could see the bank giving the run around,#ms.357.14
u,he will make more profit reselling the property...which surely this is the basis behind HOEPA, now prohibiting asset-based lending practices...#ms.357.15
u,but does not make sense to properties that are upside down and a borrower trying to make good.#ms.357.16
u,For sure, "Continuity of Contact" ...one guy or gal, one number that can play the role of intermediary reducing the "lost in translation" effect between borrower and company...#ms.357.17
u,create more jobs!!!#ms.357.18
u,Though it may be a good point,#ms.362.0
u,that would only or should apply if they are BUYING IT...#ms.362.1
u,what is happening is that service companies do just that...#ms.362.2
u,only service and do NOT really have invested interest outside of the fees they would collect.#ms.362.3
u,Again, as long as the borrower pays...everything is smooth.#ms.362.4
u,It is NOT until the borrower doesnt pay is when we see inconsistencies with these loans and how the data is handled.#ms.362.5
u,Problem: Every place where there is not transparency in lending there is fraud.#ms.364.0
u,Solution: All account activity directly and indirectly in your account has to be on the monthly statement addressing companies by name not category.#ms.364.1
u,Problem: "depending on circumstances"#ms.364.2
u,Solution: No, ALL circumstances#ms.364.3
