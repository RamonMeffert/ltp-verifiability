2,"u","Seems not too complicated.","apr",1114,2
3,"n","Many airlines will also notify your cell email whatever if you have it in their frequent flier info.","apr",1114,3
4,"u","That would also  be helpful","apr",1114,4

7,"n","A flight is a flight.","apr",1114,7
8,"u","The rule should apply to all.","apr",1114,8
9,"u","I don't see the harm in banning at least the service of peanuts on the airlines.","apr",70,0
10,"u","The ban should include all peanut and peanut containing products.","apr",70,1
11,"e","Recently we flew across the country and followed all of the procedures the airline gave us in turn they promised to clean seats and  create a buffer zone to sheild my 3 year old son from any peanut exposure.","apr",70,2
12,"e","As I walked to me seat expecting what I was promised I find left over peanuts in our seats!","apr",70,3
13,"e","I came prepared with wipes and medicine just in case.","apr",70,4
14,"e","The airline offered no assistance in fixing the problem.","apr",70,5
15,"e","After cleaning everything up and getting all settled in, I had to hold my son for the next 5 hours","apr",70,6
16,"u","because it was too risky.","apr",70,7
17,"n","At the onset of an attack the use of an epi-pen would give us about 20 minutes to be in a hospital.","apr",70,8
18,"e","During the snack a member of the flight crew pointed at us and told the other passengers that he could not offer them peanut MandMs","apr",70,9
19,"e","because there was an allergy sufferer on board.","apr",70,10
20,"e","Thankfully, after a dose of benadryl my son was fine.","apr",70,11
21,"u","I do think the passenger should come equipped with medication if case of exposure.","apr",70,12
22,"n","Most severe allergy suffers carry medicine with them anyway.","apr",70,13
23,"u","It would not hurt for the airline to carry addition medication","apr",70,14
24,"n","because the epi-pen only allows 20 minutes to seek immediate medical attention.","apr",70,15
25,"u","I don't see the harm in banning at least the service of peanuts on the airlines.","apr",73,0
26,"u","The ban should include all peanut and peanut containing products.","apr",73,1

29,"e","After this experience we only fly with Southwest!","apr",73,4
30,"u","TELL THE TRUTH immediately, boys,","apr",971,0
31,"u","and treat passengers like valued human beings.","apr",971,1
32,"u","That's it.","apr",971,2
33,"u","Southwest does it,","apr",971,3
34,"u","and they have the most loyal passengers in the industry.","apr",971,4
35,"u","It CAN be done, if you have the will to do it.","apr",971,5
36,"n","The price SW shows online is the REAL price, not a teaser fare that shoots up rapidly when the taxes, fees, surcharges, etc. are added.","apr",971,6
37,"n","SW does not charge me nuisance fees .","apr",971,7
38,"u","If they can do it, so can the rest of you.","apr",971,8
39,"u","I just wish BWI were closer to the Northern VA location I frequent,","apr",971,9

41,"e","I fly at least once every week, usually between Columbus, OH and the DC area.","apr",971,11
42,"n","During the past year the Sunday night delays on USAir , United , and even SW  in that order have been abismal, with delays at LEAST 30-50% of the time.","apr",971,12
43,"e","When cancellations were made, passengers weren't told until 5-10 minutes before departure.","apr",971,13
44,"e","These have mostly been mechanical problems , crew shortages, and non-severe weather.","apr",971,14
45,"u","Efficient, effective management would prevent the vast majority of these problems.","apr",971,15
46,"e","On Sunday, June 13 I was scheduled on US3234 DCA-CMH at 4:55 pm.","apr",971,16
47,"e","When I arrived at the gate the plane and crew were there.","apr",971,17
48,"e","At about 10 min. before boarding time the gate agent said they'd made a minor repair to the plane,","apr",971,18
49,"e","This went on until after 7 pm, at which time I re-booked for the next morning and went home.","apr",971,19
50,"e","The plane did eventually fly, 3 hours late,","apr",971,20
51,"e","but meanwhile I've wasted 5 hours sitting at an overheated, overcrowded, hopelessly noisy National Airport","apr",971,21
52,"n","because USAir can't get paperwork faxed from BRAZIL.","apr",971,22
53,"u","They are bound to occur.","apr",971,23
54,"u","Plan for it and head off these problems.","apr",971,24
55,"e","During last winter's blizzards in the East, SW was the only airline that told the truth and notified us many hours in advance that flights were cancelled.","apr",971,25
56,"e","United and USAir constantly insisted the flights were going, when in fact they were not.","apr",971,26
57,"u","If the carriers want the privilege of using our air space and our public airports , they should be held to this standard.","apr",971,27
58,"u","TELL THE TRUTH AS SOON AS YOU KNOW IT, and fix the problem promptly if it's anything other than severe weather that is truly beyond your control.","apr",971,28
59,"u","I strongly support any provision that would provide air travelers with additional timely information regarding flight delays.","apr",1197,0
60,"n","In many cases a traveler may need to make other plans to reach his or her destination,","apr",1197,1
61,"n","and the lack of information regarding flight delays may limit his or her ability to do so.","apr",1197,2
62,"u","DOT should require that when a fare or rate can only be achieved if two persons book that both the one person rate be displayed or provided unless it is clear that the person booking is booking for two.","apr",1205,0
63,"u","DOT should not adopt a less strict approach to post-purchase price increases.","apr",1205,1
64,"n","If I buy a TV at Best Buy, Best Buy cannot come after me later to wring more money out of me.","apr",1205,2
65,"n","A traveler enters into a contract with an airline whereby the traveler pays a price so that the airline with transport the person somewhere on an agreed-upon date and time.","apr",1205,3
66,"n","When the airline later changes the price, it is effectively breaking the contract and extorting money out of the traveler who likely will lose more money it he or she objects.","apr",1205,4
67,"n","Given the fact that travelers contract for airline travel at different times or dates between the time the airline posts the flight and the date of travel, and people already know that prices can change if they do not buy a ticket, the airline can raise ticket prices on seats purchased later.","apr",1205,5
68,"n","Further, the airline likely will include possible fuel price fluctuations in their calculation of ticket fares or prices.","apr",1205,6
69,"u","Regarding ticket prices, I believe airlines should be required to publish a comparable, typical fare regardless of how they otherwise choose to display their pricing structure.","apr",1205,7
70,"u","For instance, all airlines should be required to publish the price, fee and tax inclusive, to fly round-trip with one checked bag to the destination.","apr",1205,8
71,"n","This would allow travelers to compare prices between carriers","apr",1205,9
72,"n","because the price would be for the same thing.","apr",1205,10
73,"u","To the extent other services could be provided , that could be displayed separately as an opt-in.","apr",1205,11
74,"u","The biggest issue I have as a traveler with the various prices and airline price structures is that there is no comparability.","apr",1205,12
75,"u","While I think I may be getting a good deal with one carrier,","apr",1205,13
76,"n","there always seems to be some other amount I later must pay","apr",1205,14
77,"u","that, were it figured into the mix when I made the decision of which carrier to fly with, could have caused me to choose a different carrier.","apr",1205,15
78,"u","Any foreign carrier that operates in the U.S. should be subject to U.S. rules with respect to U.S. flights.","apr",1216,0
79,"n","Those carriers are making money off U.S. travelers,","apr",1216,1
80,"u","consequently they should be required to follow the rules here.","apr",1216,2
81,"e","First, I have my fair share of allergies and have spent a fair share of time in the ER, with allergic reactions.","apr",292,0
82,"u","As a parent, I understand the pain that some of the parents have related in their stories.","apr",292,1
83,"n","We, the ones with allergies are very few and far between, when we consider the flying public.","apr",292,2
84,"e","I have my share of epi-pens, in the event one is needed or prednisone, should I have a case of anaphylaxis.","apr",292,3
85,"u","As they say in the BSA, ""Be Prepared.""","apr",292,4
86,"u","I guess I am fortunate","apr",292,5
87,"e","since my symptomology is always similar in nature and covers a four to 12 hour period:  Itchy skin, itchy scalp, swelling of joints, poor demeanor, then hives and off to the ER if an anti-anaphylaxis drug isn't in use by the time hives break out,","apr",292,6
88,"e","which is usually 4 hours after the first symptoms start to manifest themselves or the scalp becomes itchy.","apr",292,7
89,"u","If this is a case where people, with these allergies are deemed ""handicapped, these people should have their medication on their person, to mitigate anaphylaxis.","apr",292,8
90,"e","I do.","apr",292,9
91,"n","After the medication is ingested or injected, relief comes in less than five minutes","apr",292,10
92,"u","and the only discomfort I have had is a case of the sweats and  or  or a minor headache.","apr",292,11
93,"n","When peanuts are served, they come individually wrapped","apr",292,12
94,"u","and it is the responsibility of the passenger to dispose of the wrapper, accordingly.","apr",292,13
95,"u","I regret to say that although pretzels have been offered as an alternative, they aren't a substitute for peanuts.","apr",292,14
96,"n","Also, I have been advised that cashews are edible by people with peanut allergies and could be used as a substitute.","apr",292,15
97,"n","Since medication is portable ,","apr",292,16
98,"u","I believe that a warning that peanuts are being used is sufficent and that flight attendents be trained in the usage of epi-pens for this purpose.","apr",292,17
99,"n","When airlines are forced to limit the types of food it can serve, esecially when less than 1% of the flying public it serves, it impacts price, quality of service and capitulates to the will of the very small minority,","apr",292,18
100,"n","in which there is a ready solution that is present.","apr",292,19
101,"u","I say ""no"" to such a food rule and would encourage all passengers and parents to execise a little responsibility and be pro-active in the introduction of the appropriate medication, when necessary.","apr",292,20
102,"n","Note: A long time ago, to be a flight attendent, one also had to be a Registered Nurse.","apr",292,21
103,"u","There is NO COMPARISON.","apr",293,0
104,"n","Tobacco smoke, unlike peanuts, not only affects EVERYBODY, it also affects the HVAC and electronics  or  avionics, on-board an aircraft.","apr",293,1
105,"u","Anybody who had done a ""C"" or ""D"" check aboard aircraft in the 70's and 80's can tell the difference, especially with the tobacco gunk on the wires and avionics.","apr",293,2
106,"n","Peanuts does not have same health risks ""to innocent passengers, as tobacco smoke.","apr",293,3
107,"n","This becomes especially true if there is knowledge and forewarning that the affected passenger assumes that peanuts are going to be served and efforts to mitigate the situation are employed.","apr",293,4
108,"u","While I support the DOT's effort to make sure the fees are published upfront,","apr",1121,0
109,"u","I do think there need to be limits on some fees, chief among them carry on luggage.","apr",1121,1
110,"u","If the airlines are charging for checked baggage, there need to be rules preventing them from charging for carry ons.","apr",1121,2
111,"u","It is not acceptable for airlines to have what is in effect a mandatory fee for carrying any luggage at all on a vacation.","apr",1121,3
112,"u","Luggage is not something that very many air travelers can cut out altogether,","apr",1121,4
113,"u","the DOT should step in and prevent them from charging fees on all of it.","apr",1121,5
114,"n","In relation to mthornt1's point, the overhead bins are not the only place to put luggage.","apr",1121,6
115,"n","There is room under the seats that is designed for luggage as well.","apr",1121,7
116,"u","If airlines have restrictions on carryons, it's up to them to determine how much they want to enforce them.","apr",1121,8
117,"u","Reading most of the comments it seems that the biggest concern is peanut allergy sufferers inhaling peanut particles.","apr",725,0
118,"u","Perhaps instead of banning peanuts and peanut products outright.","apr",725,1
119,"n","Airlines and the DOT can provide sufferers with HEPA airmasks","apr",725,2
120,"u","which I assume will prevent individuals from inhaling peanut dust.","apr",725,3
121,"u","I would think this approach would be of minimal cost  and would not require a ban. If touch is a problem dressing accordingly can help decrease the amount.","apr",725,4
122,"u","I would say that if someone still insists upon a ban if these measures would work that we are then getting into a debate of my rights over your rights and my want to be comfortable compared to your want to be comfortable which definitely takes us out of the need to protect life arena","apr",725,5
123,"u","I think the government should do studies if they insist upon a ban and should not put one into effect without such a study.","apr",725,6
124,"u","I think the DOT should prove that peanuts on planes will cause the problems that other commenters are concerned about.","apr",729,0
125,"n","Controlled studies demonstrating that peanuts eaten in one portion of an airplane will be sent through the air into other portions.","apr",729,1
126,"n","Studies that can show that there is enough residue left from others eating peanuts to trigger reactions.","apr",729,2
127,"u","Although anecdotal evidence is helpful","apr",729,3
128,"u","and I do not doubt the veracity of the claims made by others","apr",729,4
129,"u","I think facts and statistics need to be considered.","apr",729,5
130,"u","perhaps some concerns such as air circulation can be alleviated.","apr",729,6
131,"u","then creating a buffer zone would make more sense.","apr",729,7
132,"u","The problem is that when such a subject comes up everyone uses emotion to make a decision and decisions of this nature should also be made with considering scientific facts.","apr",729,8
133,"u","I am concerned that any solution will lull travelers with peanut allergies into a false sense of security.","apr",674,0
134,"u","It may prevent the airline itself from serving peanuts,","apr",674,1
135,"e","I do not suffer peanut allergies,","apr",674,2
136,"u","nor do I know anyone who has them .","apr",674,3
137,"n","I do realize though that there is a growing trend of more and more Americans being allergic to peanuts.","apr",674,4
138,"u","I'm not sure why.","apr",674,5
139,"u","Personally, I suspect it's something in the environment -- maybe chemicals in our food , plastics, etc.","apr",674,6
140,"u","Who knows.","apr",674,7
141,"n","But it does appear that the allergies are on the increase --","apr",674,8
142,"n","and something is causing it.","apr",674,9
143,"u","I'm not sure how realistic bans on peanuts really are -- especially in environments like airplanes.","apr",674,10
144,"u","These bans make sense in day care and schools where parents and kids can be educated about the issues, and the same consumers  return to the same location every day.","apr",674,11
145,"u","However, with air travel, it's really more about educating the entire American public about the dangers of peanuts to remedy the situation...","apr",674,12
146,"u","there seem to be more important medical issues taking more lives that should be higher on the overall public agenda.","apr",674,13
147,"u","ricport - ""total responsibility"" is only possible when you have control.","apr",255,0
148,"n","when you have both feet on the ground, you can drop everything and get to emergency services within 20 minutes.","apr",255,1
149,"u","Adequate preparation = reducing possibility of exposure and carrying epipens just in case -","apr",255,2
150,"n","but they only buy you 20minutes or so","apr",255,3
151,"n","and limit is 2 without medical supervision.","apr",255,4
152,"u","so, small-minded pax eating peanuts at 30,000 feet and unsympathetic crew could = death.","apr",255,5
153,"u","and as for nannying, my experience is that government treats people according to the way they're acting.","apr",255,6
154,"u","it's a question of degree to which the allergic traveler  can reasonably manage the risks.","apr",256,0
155,"u","When in the terminal , exposure can be managed or avoided and if anything happnes, emergency services are a 911 call away and the ambulance can get you to a hospital before the epipen wear off.","apr",256,1
156,"n","When in an aircraft, the traveler is confined","apr",256,2
157,"n","and if anything happens, the epipens still buy you 20 minutes","apr",256,3
158,"n","but you're no closer to a hospital.","apr",256,4
159,"e","While I am no expert,","apr",479,0
160,"u","I believe that a variety of simulations could empirically address this issue.","apr",479,1
161,"u","One would need to determine the required concentration of airborne particles to spark an allergic reaction in the most medically sensitive individual - thereby setting the threshold level of airborne peanut particulate.","apr",479,2
162,"n","That said, as other commenters have noted, airborne peanut particulate is not the sole cause of an allergic reaction.","apr",479,3
163,"u","I do, however, take issue with the phrasing of this question.","apr",479,4
164,"u","Clearly, the genesis of the question is that allergic reactions to peanuts can be fatal.","apr",479,5
165,"u","The question should address *potentially fatal* allergic reactions.","apr",479,6
166,"u","If the danger being addressed is any and all allergic peanut reaction, the answer is ""none.""","apr",479,7
167,"u","If the danger being addressed is a *potentially fatal* allergic reaction, airlines should stop serving peanuts and contributing to a potentially dangerous environment.","apr",479,8
168,"u","However, an outright restriction on what passengers may be permitted to bring on board is excessive and, potentially, unenforceable.","apr",479,9
169,"u","Transportation security challenges are already too great to include enforcement of a ban on all peanut products.","apr",479,10
170,"u","Furthermore, it is unreasonable to assume that the average citizen is fully aware of the peanut content  of their snack items.","apr",479,11
171,"u","No all-out ban will fully eliminate a potentially fatal environment, and DOT should not encourage such a false sense of security to those travelers who might be concerned about this matter.","apr",479,12
172,"u","If the study outlined in my first response yielded a reasonable ppm threshold of peanut particulate, DOT could work with airlines and airliner manufacturers to install the appropriate systems that would alert passengers to the risk as well as neutralize that risk.","apr",479,13
173,"u","I cannot answer the first part.","apr",479,14
174,"n","As for the second part, airlines already carry portable defibrilators.","apr",479,15
175,"u","Carrying EpiPens would not be an undue burden.","apr",479,16
176,"u","Airlines, however, should expect that passengers or parents would carry their own EpiPens.","apr",479,17
177,"u","Airlines should not be expected to administer EpiPen treatments to unaccompanied children, and children with such allergies should not be permitted to fly unaccompanied.","apr",479,18
178,"u","airlines should not contribute to an environment that endangers their passengers.","apr",479,19
179,"u","However, passenger choices should not be restricted, if reasonable assurance can be given that passenger food or snack choices do not contribute to a potentially fatal environment.","apr",479,20
180,"n","It is true that the quality of delay information is not always within the airline's control.","apr",527,0
181,"u","Often, when the FAA institutes the practice of ""metering"" due to weather or high volume, the airline really can't advise the customers of the reason for a delay.","apr",527,1
182,"n","In fact, in order to retain the right to take off, the airlines are required to load the plane and sit on the tarmac while the FAA figures out how to route traffic.","apr",527,2
183,"u","Furthermore, having listened to ground control or tower communications on United flights, it's clear that the controllers can give an estimated delay,","apr",527,3
184,"n","but that delay is subject to change.","apr",527,4
185,"u","Again, the airline's information is only as good as the FAA's information - and, well, the situation is fluid.","apr",527,5
186,"u","To that end, DOT's rule must consider that FAA's traffic management practices and procedures might necessarily inhibit airlines' ability to comply with such regulations.","apr",527,6
187,"n","Southwest says they apply 100% to a new ticket","apr",948,0
188,"n","but there always seems to be a price increase or that price ticket is not available or some other excuse so that you always have to pay more.","apr",948,1
189,"n","Also the ticket expires in one year,","apr",948,2
190,"n","so you fly or you lose it.","apr",948,3
191,"u","I proposed an answer to overbooking in another area.","apr",965,0
192,"n","The airlines know how many seats they have on a flight and how many tickets they have sold for the flight.","apr",965,1
193,"u","Each passenger should be guaranteed a seat up to the number of seats on the flight,","apr",965,2
194,"u","after that passengers should be sold standby seats numbered 1-n, first come, first served.","apr",965,3
195,"u","This is neat and simple and there is no question of who gets a seat if they show up.","apr",965,4
196,"u","Southwest has a pretty good business model;","apr",966,0
197,"u","they are cheerful and friendly and accommodating.","apr",966,1
198,"n","And their fares are still mostly bundled.","apr",966,2
199,"n","When the airlines changed their business model they reduced service AND increased fares, they just claimed they were trying to be fairer to the customers.","apr",966,3
200,"u","And they definitely don't have a cheerful, friendly, accommodating business atmosphere.","apr",966,4
201,"u","I predict that airlines are hastening their own demise when they engage in their anti customer and certainly unethical behavior.","apr",966,5
202,"u","Transferability and any other ""change"" type fees are for revenue production only and not for services rendered.","apr",967,0
203,"u","They already are using our money for free sometimes for months in advance.","apr",967,1
204,"n","Most of us make changes online at negligible or no cost to the airline.","apr",967,2
205,"u","For those who call a real person there is already  a service fee for that as well so they are really double dipping.","apr",967,3
206,"n","And then there's the effect of all the extra carry-ons on the cabin crew:","apr",1131,0
207,"n","They all seem to settle into the $15-$35 each way.","apr",1139,0
208,"n","The airlines aren't competing on price for checked baggage.","apr",1139,1
209,"u","I think the best solution is $0.","apr",1139,2
210,"e","As the mother of a child with a life threatening peanut allergy","apr",1266,0
211,"u","I have had to consider this issue carefully.","apr",1266,1
212,"e","I am also a physician.","apr",1266,2
213,"e","We carry 4 epi pens and benadryl, wipe everything down, and bring his own food.","apr",1266,3
214,"e","Fortunately we have not had a problem,","apr",1266,4

216,"n","since they serve peanuts to the whole plane.","apr",1266,6
217,"u","Having flown without him on Delta, the smell of peanuts being opened by 150 people at the same time was enough to convince me we'd have a problem.","apr",1266,7
218,"u","I don't expect airlines to regulate what foods people bring on a plane,","apr",1266,8
219,"u","but I don't understand why everyone has to be handed a bag of peanuts that they will open and spread the dust throughout the plane.","apr",1266,9
220,"u","I know its up to me to be prepared","apr",1266,10
221,"u","Epinephrine wears off quickly,","apr",1266,11
222,"u","so even treating someone appropriately doesn't cure a reaction","apr",1266,12
223,"u","and definitive treatment is necessary.","apr",1266,13
224,"u","I'll continue to avoid Delta when traveling with my son and continue to be prepared while on other airlines,","apr",1266,14
225,"u","but it would be so much simpler if the airline didn't hand out  a life threatening substance that people can do without for the short duration of a flight.","apr",1266,15
226,"e","As an air traveler and peanut-allergy sufferer,","apr",179,0

410,"u","From a passenger perspective, I believe there are actually three deficiencies that drive the current communication problem, and resulting shortcomings in the system:","apr",141,2
411,"n","* There is a major disconnect in information between gate agents and reservation agents;","apr",141,3
412,"n","* There is no prompt communication between the airline and the passenger ;","apr",141,4
413,"n","* and There is no way to guarantee re-booking or re-routing, without penalty, without going to the airport.","apr",141,5
414,"n","As a result, even when there is a high likelihood that a flight will be canceled, passengers go to the airport, often at significant expense, then must wait in long lines, causing havoc inside the airport, and creating the inefficient system that we are all familiar with.","apr",141,6
415,"u","I believe these three together are the source of the problem and would like to illustrate this with a brief example:","apr",141,7
416,"e","This winter, I had a vacation booked to Colorado to ski.","apr",141,8
417,"e","On the day of travel there was heavy snow in New York City.","apr",141,9
418,"u","To me it was obvious that my flight would be canceled.","apr",141,10
419,"e","However, despite repeated calls to the airline, I was assured that the flight was showing to depart on-time .","apr",141,11
420,"e","However, knowing that if the flight did leave, even if that were 5 hours later, I would face a steep re-booking expense , I went to the airport regardless .","apr",141,12
421,"u","Upon arrival at the airport, and after checking my skis curbside, my fears were of course confirmed,","apr",141,13
422,"e","the flight had been canceled,","apr",141,14
423,"e","and there were long lines at all of the agent counters and the gates.","apr",141,15
424,"e","I then waited in line for an hour, re-booked, waited another hour to collect my bag, and returned home.","apr",141,16
425,"e","The monetary expense for me was $150 in cab rides and tips, and 5 hours in time, and one day of lost skiing.","apr",141,17
426,"e","None of which was claimable or reimbursable.","apr",141,18
427,"u","* Airlines should be required to invest in systems that streamline information so that information among their reservations agents is as current as it is at the gate;","apr",141,19
428,"u","* In addition to notifying passengers about their flight promptly , there should be earlier, and more frequent communication about overall ""Airport Health"" on the day of travel.","apr",141,20
429,"u","For example, just letting a passenger know about his or her flight in advance does not necessarily help at all.","apr",141,21
430,"u","If that communication comes less than 90 minutes before departure, it is outside of the window in which a passenger can react:","apr",141,22
431,"n","he or she is already on the way to the airport.","apr",141,23
432,"u","However, if an earlier communication were:  ""Due to heavy snow, all flights this morning have been departing 1-2 hours behind schedule.  Please prepare for delays or possibility of cancellation.  We will provide another status update in one hour.""  This is a communication that a passenger can thoughtfully incorporate into his or her planning.","apr",141,24
433,"u","* Finally, Rules should be developed defining the conditions under which a passenger can rebook without charge.","apr",141,25
434,"u","Perhaps if the flight is going to be delayed more than 3 hours, it is better for the passenger and the airline to let a passenger rebook.","apr",141,26
435,"n","Sometimes the flight is overbooked anyway.","apr",141,27
436,"u","I believe further consideration of the above collectively would result in a far better passenger experience, and more efficient airline management.","apr",141,28
437,"u","Such notifications are ""nice"" for relatively short delays .","apr",169,0
438,"u","Often however they don;t know how long a flight will be delayed if it is a mechanical issue or if thunderstorms have caused a back up of landing or take-off traffic.","apr",169,1

2050,"u","There's no reason a non-escrow loan can't be treated the same as an escrow loan and that is a 100% verifiable FACT that you are only disputing in order to dodge regulation.","ms",278,5
2051,"u","Nice try, but I'm an expert on loan tracking, and I know better.","ms",278,6
2052,"u","I do not seem to be able to reply to Moderator's post, so I will start a new comment here.","ms",290,0
2053,"n","1. Yes, it is often the case that forced insurance is cheaper than regular insurance.","ms",290,1
2054,"n","2. It has always been the case that money held in escrow to pay for taxes and insurance was an expense that was prepaid by the borrower.","ms",290,2
2055,"u","RESPA is filled with rules on how to calculate escrow deposits and make sure that the buffer is no more than 2 month's worth of payments.","ms",290,3
2056,"u","If a borrower is in default on his loan, there is insufficient funds in his escrow to pay his insurance.","ms",290,4
2057,"u","I will always continue paying the taxes because taxes are a priority lien.","ms",290,5
2058,"u","But the insurance is nothing but an expense.","ms",290,6
2059,"u","If the borrower has reneged on his responsibility to make his monthly mortgage payments and also allows his fire insurance to cancel, then I as the mortgagee should have the right to protect my interest in the collateral property in a reasonable manner, one which will not possibly cause me to lose more money.","ms",290,7
2060,"u","1. There are a lot of variables which determine the cost of the HO Ins policy.","ms",290,8
2061,"u","Credit history and property location are probably the two most important.","ms",290,9
2062,"u","$100,000 of forced placed insurance would cost, through my provider, $1,545.00.","ms",290,10
2063,"n","A HO Ins policy through a traditional carrier with dwelling coverage of $200,000.00 could cost, based upon my experiences, between $600 and $2,000.","ms",290,11
2064,"e","But I deal with smaller balance loans of 10K to 30K, where the cost of the forced placed policy is almost always less than the HO Ins premium.","ms",290,12
2065,"u","So, there is no simple formula that we can use to say that when the mortgage is paid down by X percent, forced insurance will be less expensive than traditional coverage.","ms",290,13
2066,"u","2.  Although I would happily accept an exception for mortgagees who service their own loans , I think the rule should be based on a solid principal.","ms",290,14
2067,"u","As the rule stands now, someone -- either the servicer or the note owner  -- is being required to pay out more money than it has to in order to protect its interest in the property.","ms",290,15
2068,"u","Just because the servicer is different from the note owner really should not make a difference.","ms",290,16
2069,"u","Someone is being forced to potentially lose more money than necessary.","ms",290,17
2070,"u","In my opinion, if the borrower in default is properly notified that his HO Ins policy will no longer be escrowed, and if the borrower in default fails in his responsibility to keep the policy in force, then I believe the mortgagee or the servicer should be free to place a forced policy to protect its interest.","ms",290,18
2071,"n","As we have discussed previously, if I pay the customer's premium on his HO Ins policy, he can cancel the policy and receive the refund.","ms",290,19
2072,"u","Asking me to pay the HO Ins policy for a borrower in default in monthly installments seems to me to be a tremendous additional burden.","ms",290,20
2073,"u","This may sound harsh, but when I make someone a loan, I don't want to become his surrogate mother who has to pay his bills when he can't or won't.","ms",290,21
2074,"u","3.  The CFPB's alternative proposal is certainly more appealing than the existing proposed rule.","ms",290,22
2075,"u","In my situation, the forced placed policy will most likely cost less than the HO Ins policy.","ms",290,23
2076,"u","So, I can accept it for sure, but I don't think it is based on a sound principal.","ms",290,24
2077,"u","As a drawback to the alternative rule, I do see some litigation issues.","ms",290,25
2078,"u","If I choose forced insurance over the defaulted borrower's HO Ins policy, and there is a loss, some heavy litigation could result.","ms",290,26
2079,"u","But overall, I absolutely prefer the alternative proposal.""","ms",290,27
2080,"e","After submitting a formal complaint through CFPB, the servicer has partially relented.","ms",292,0
2081,"u","The ""apology"" was veiled and sarcastic, I'm not surprised.","ms",292,1

2087,"u","I am partially relieved but this is a glaring example of a servicer who spends time and resources negatively towards the homeowners rather than positively.","ms",292,7
2088,"u","I want to see the law changed to stop this kind of abuse, and to alleviate the tens of thousands of others still suffering under this unfair servicer policy.","ms",292,8

2091,"u","However , there is 1 very big problem that will have devastating consequences if not fixed.","ms",297,1
2092,"u","Under Transaction Activity"" there needs to be three categories. 1 ""Charges""  2 ""Payments received""  3 ""Payments paid out"".","ms",297,2
2093,"u","This statement still allows banks to generate bogus bills under generic categories like ""property inspection fee"".","ms",297,3

2095,"u","Any time the bank charges your account for something, it should be required to list the company that you are obligated to pay, by company name and contact information.","ms",297,5
2096,"u","This way, you can verify with the company that they actually provided the service.","ms",297,6
2097,"u","If the vendor is contacted by the borrower, the vendor should have 10 days to provide a service order with the contact information for the person that actually provided the service and a copy of the bill to verify the amount received from the transaction that can be matched up against the statement","ms",297,7
2098,"u","Nobody should be able to bill you without telling you who it is you owe with out transparency so it can be verified.","ms",297,8
2099,"u","With full transparency the borrower can investigate their own loan which would  lower mortgage crime and racketeering.","ms",297,9

2101,"u","One to enter the actual service into your account and the second to record the actual payment from your account to the vendor.","ms",297,11
2102,"u","If Chase is keeping $10.00 of this amount then the paid out for this service needs to be split IN THE ACCOUNT AND any money Chase receives in reference to your loan in any given month should be in ""Transaction Activity"" and explained.","ms",297,12

2122,"e","and it happens to be the amount for several drive by inspections to the penny.","ms",297,32

2358,"u","I don't know if Green Tree is a ""small servicer"",","ms",232,8

2384,"u","I'm never sure if anyone reads this stuff or cares.","ms",329,0
2385,"u","What the CFPB does will be very important to borrowers and service providers.","ms",329,1
2386,"u","I don't agree that size is a necessary condition for excellent service.","ms",329,2
2387,"e","We work with financial institutions that service from 10 loans to 10,000","ms",329,3
2388,"u","and the largest give as good and sometimes better service than the smallest.","ms",329,4
2389,"u","I believe that most sophisticated financial institutions understand that the total potential relationship a borrower can bring is substantially greater than the value of the servicing strip.","ms",329,5
2390,"u","These relationships often develop and evolve over a period of time.","ms",329,6
2391,"u","If the financial does not meet the borrower's service level expectations the borrower is more likely to go somewhere else for the other relationships including their next mortgage.","ms",329,7
2392,"u","Retaining mortgage customers is a critical component of managing the relationship.","ms",329,8
2393,"u","Depending on the assumptions as to size of loan, frequency of refinancing or purchasing, future economic position of the borrower, etc. we believe the value of the relationship today is worth 4-5x the value of the servicing strip.","ms",329,9
2394,"u","Earning this value is a very strong motivator that should result in great service.","ms",329,10
2395,"u","Not everyone believes in the value of the relationship, but I do not think  belief is highly correlated with size.","ms",329,11
2396,"e","I am with a company that services mortgage loans.","ms",329,12
2397,"e","We have never sold servicing.","ms",329,13
2398,"u","One reason is simply that the value offered is generally around 20% of the value of the relationship.","ms",329,14
2399,"u","Another even more important reason is that we believe that you cannot both focus on the value of relationships and sell servicing.","ms",329,15
2400,"u","Buying and selling are transactions.","ms",329,16
2401,"u","Relationships are long term investments.","ms",329,17
2402,"u","None of the institutions we work with have ever sold servicing.","ms",329,18
2403,"u","So one of the measures I would use to determine if an institution should be exempted is,","ms",329,19
2404,"u","If it has it cannot qualify for exemption regardless of its size.","ms",329,20
2405,"u","In my opinion this is a necessary but not sufficient condition for exemption.","ms",329,21
2406,"u","I know of many small institutions that sell servicing.","ms",329,22
2407,"u","I have never seen a seller of servicing large or small that had a quality of service provided by a purchaser of the servicing as a requirement for sale.","ms",329,23
2408,"u","It has almost always been determined by the amount the purchaser would pay.","ms",329,24
2409,"u","There are many companies that will facilitate purchases and sales.","ms",329,25
2410,"u","I believe they would agree with me on this point.","ms",329,26
2411,"u","I have several other thoughts but this is getting almost too long to read.","ms",329,27
2412,"u","I realize that my position my seem a bit extreme.","ms",329,28
