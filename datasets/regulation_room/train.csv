0,"u","DOT's objective in setting this rule should be to ELIMINATE all bumping, not merely achieve some  reduction.","apr",522,0
1,"u","Regardless of how many caveats an airline might state in its contract terms, passengers neither want nor deserve a ticket for an oversold seat.","apr",522,1
2,"u","Bumping is a purely economic device that treats passengers as economic units devoid of humanity, like so many other aspects of airline behavior.","apr",522,2
3,"u","From that objective, it follows that there should be NO cap on compensation and that the financial penalty to the airline should be strong enough to prevent bumping, not just keep it at some arbitrarily ""acceptable"" level.","apr",522,3
4,"u","The 100% of the total ticket price for expected arrival within 2 hours later is reasonable.","apr",522,4
5,"u","Compensation for a longer delay should be the GREATER of 200% of the total ticket cost or the passenger's demonstrable out-of-pocket costs resulting from the delay  including any higher priced air ticket from the same or another carrier at the same class, and lodging, meals and incidentals at average prevailing prices in that metro area, and  with the obligation on the passenger to minimize those costs by arranging, with good faith help from the airline, an alternate flight or other means to get him or her to the destination as soon as reasonably practical.","apr",522,5
6,"u","I strongly support cash compensation for bumping passengers with zero-price tickets, e.g., those from frequent-flier programs.","apr",523,0
7,"u","But to assure adequate compensation and prevent airlines gaming such a requirement, compensation should be at the average  ticket price for that service class on that flight.","apr",523,1
8,"u","DOT's proposed rule using the lowest fare ticket would encourage airlines to bump those with zero-price tickets first,","apr",523,2
9,"u","since that cost would be lowest.","apr",523,3
10,"u","As long as they continue to offer tickets for miles, airlines should not be encouraged to treat passengers using those tickets as second-class when it comes to bumping.","apr",523,4
11,"u","The growing scarcity of actual seats for miles -- something that cries out for regulatory intervention -- is bad enough.","apr",523,5
12,"u","The proposals are certainly reasonable and should also be extended to include on-line booking services","apr",32,0
13,"u","since that could be a potential loophole for the airlines not to comply.","apr",32,1
14,"u","There is another growing problem that needs to be addressed, limitation on in-flight sales and solicitation.","apr",33,0
15,"u","One US carrier has mastered this art.","apr",33,1
16,"u","Flight attendants are on the intercom from take-off to landing selling everything from MasterCards to sandwiches.","apr",33,2
17,"e","I boarded USA in Miami in March","apr",33,3
18,"e","and it was the coldest airplance I've ever seen.","apr",33,4
19,"e","Moments later when the lady across the aisle asked for a blanket for her and her young child she was told they had no complimentary ones but could sell her two!","apr",33,5
20,"e","There is NO question in my mind the reason the plane was so cold was to generate blanket sales.","apr",33,6
21,"u","This is just wrong.","apr",33,7
22,"u","What many people who are supporting a ban are forgetting  is if someone has such a severe peanut allergy that a reaction occurs when breathing or touching something else that has been contaminated , then *all* aircrafts that have ever had peanuts aboard are contaminated.","apr",613,0
23,"n","Banning future peanuts doesn't change that cross-contamination is already in place and it's already a life-threatening environment.","apr",613,1
24,"u","Not feasible.","apr",613,2
25,"e","I, too, suffer from a life-threatening food allergy;","apr",613,3
26,"u","but I do not expect the world to change for me.","apr",613,4
27,"e","I adjust to the world;","apr",613,5
28,"e","if I think there's a chance that I will be exposed to my food ""poison, I don't go there.","apr",613,6
29,"u","It's inconvenient and sometimes a hardship for me,","apr",613,7
30,"e","but I'm the one with the allergy.","apr",613,8
31,"u","Unfortunately, there are no guarantees in this world.","apr",613,9
32,"u","Probably.","apr",613,10
33,"u","The problem is that banning peanuts alone won't make life on a plane safer;","apr",613,11
34,"u","it'll only be as safe as fellow passengers or airline staff taking precautions for the risk","apr",613,12
35,"u","and, frankly, those who don't have or know anyone who has life-threatening allergies have no idea how easily cross-contamination can occur.","apr",613,13
36,"e","As someone with such an allergy,","apr",613,14
37,"u","there's no way I would place my trust for my life on strangers to take precautions for my allergy.","apr",613,15
38,"u","Banning isn't a real solution; finding a cure is.","apr",613,16
39,"u","It is unfortunate that the airlines have forced the government to step and and set limits by holding passengers hostage on the tarmac and treating them like items to be shipped and not people.","apr",1201,0
40,"u","While schedules must be met -","apr",1201,1
41,"u","EVERYONE is inconvenienced by flight delays, including the airline, the travelers and the airport.","apr",1201,2
42,"u","Consideration is what is needed here,","apr",1201,3
43,"u","and the airlines have proven that they cannot be considerate to the travelers without a rule.","apr",1201,4
44,"u","Consequently, I believe a federal limit is necessary,","apr",1201,5
45,"u","however I believe there are multiple factors that should be considered.","apr",1201,6
46,"u","For instance, if a plane with 100 people on it has only 2 operating bathrooms, perhaps the timeframe should be shorter than a plane with more bathrooms in operation.","apr",1201,7
47,"u","Further, I would think the delay for a smaller plane that provides passengers with so little headroom that they cannot stand up without bending their heads  should be less than 3 hours.","apr",1201,8
48,"u","The facilities on the plane could also be a factor .","apr",1201,9
49,"u","I believe that if the airport is closed  and the bathrooms on the plane are sufficient to satisfy the needs of the travelers, there is no reason to let travelers off the plane if the plane is waiting at the gate.","apr",1201,10
50,"u","However, if the airport is open and the airline does not intend to provide travelers with food, it is appropriate for the airline to let travelers off the plane so they can get food if the wait is long.","apr",1201,11
51,"u","I see the reason for letting travelers deplane as being to allow them to obtain what they need and cannot get if they are held on the plane.","apr",1201,12
52,"u","If international passengers are allowed to disembark, but are unable to access bathrooms or shops to obtain food or reading material, I don't see that as a reasonable accommodation.","apr",1201,13
53,"n","The only reason the airlines do not want to publish their plans in their respective contracts of carriage is because people may attempt to sue them if they fail to comply with those plans.","apr",1201,14
54,"u","Not that I believe people should sue at the drop of a hat,","apr",1201,15
55,"u","but I do believe the travelers should have that as an option if the airline acts in an egregious manner.","apr",1201,16
56,"u","Thus, I believe airlines should be required to include their plans in their contracts of carriage.","apr",1201,17
57,"u","I believe that airports should have tarmac contingency plans.","apr",1201,18
58,"u","Perhaps if both the airlines and the airports were required to have plans, the back and forth would lead to better coordination.","apr",1201,19
59,"u","Throughout all, I believe the airlines should inform their travelers about the situation regularly.","apr",1201,20
60,"u","One reason for traveler angst in these situations is due to the lack of information.","apr",1201,21
61,"u","Setting traveler expectations is good.","apr",1201,22
62,"u","However, airlines also must realize that sometimes the best decision is to let the travelers get off the plane and make other travel arrangements.","apr",1201,23
63,"u","I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that airlines should be required to provide travelers with a full-fare"" price.","apr",1211,0
64,"u","This would allow travelers to compare prices between carriers and make better decisions.","apr",1211,1
65,"u","A good alternative would be to allow an individual to choose what options they will use  and provide an all-in price that includes those options .","apr",1211,2
66,"u","This would allow travelers to determine what the ""all-in"" price includes, but would still allow the traveler to compare apples to apples when determining which airline to travel with.","apr",1211,3
67,"u","ALL carriers that operate in the US should be required to display all-in fares for all flights that either begin or end in the US.","apr",1211,4
68,"u","One result I could see here would be that an airline may allow one checked bag, but the size of the bag may be smaller for some carriers than others - and the charge for oversized bags may be more.","apr",1211,5
69,"u","Oversized bags may be something one doesn't think about until one gets to the airport and then finds out the bag is too big.","apr",1211,6
70,"u","Consequently, it might be good for a more prominent display of requirements on the traveler - e.g., bag size and weight.","apr",1211,7
71,"u","As to ""code share"" price display - as a traveler, I want to know what I am paying and what the restrictions on me would be.","apr",1211,8
72,"u","If there is no cost difference for me to fly on an airline the airline I have contracted with has sub-contracted with to fly me somewhere, I am OK knowing only the all-in price.","apr",1211,9
73,"u","I think, however, that it is important for me, the traveler, to know if the subcontractor has more restrictive luggage requirements that could cause me to need to pay additional fees.","apr",1211,10
74,"u","I believe people want to know about the fees and restrictions when they arrange for travel.","apr",1211,11
75,"u","I'm not sure it is necessary to advertise changes in fees or restrictions.","apr",1211,12
76,"u","Instead, I believe the fees or restrictions should not change for a passenger that has bought his or her ticket.","apr",1211,13
77,"n","The contract between the airline and traveler is set when the ticket is purchased","apr",1211,14
78,"u","and unilateral changes to fees that affect the traveler should not be allowed.","apr",1211,15
79,"u","If that contract allows the airline to change restrictions , the airline should be required to inform affected passengers that have already purchased tickets.","apr",1211,16
80,"u","I think it is terrific that DOT is, based on its experience with customer service plans, setting minimum requirements.","apr",1215,0
81,"u","All of the requirements listed seem reasonable.","apr",1215,1
82,"u","I would not want to fly with an airline that did not do those things.","apr",1215,2
83,"u","With respect to the listed additional standards, I think it is important to note that if a bag is not delivered within 2 hours after the passenger landed on the first leg of a round-trip flight - it could be problematic.","apr",1215,3
84,"u","Whereas if it were delivered that late on the second leg of a round trip and the carrier later delivers it to the traveler's home it may not be such a big deal.","apr",1215,4
85,"u","Similarly, if the round-trip flight is over a long weekend, it is more important for the bag to catch up with the traveler quickly,","apr",1215,5
86,"u","but if the round-trip is over a two week period in one place and the airline delivers the bag to the traveler within a day it may not be as big a deal.","apr",1215,6
87,"u","Refunds for bag fees on lost bags seems appropriate.","apr",1215,7
88,"u","As to fees and taxes, I believe refunds should include any fees and taxes the carrier has not otherwise been required to pay to someone else.","apr",1215,8
89,"u","I also believe carriers should reimburse travelers for lost bags.","apr",1215,9
90,"u","If the carrier fails to deliver a bag on-time, that also should be reimbursed -","apr",1215,10
91,"u","however I believe the definition of ""on time"" could be flexible.","apr",1215,11
92,"u","It is important to carriers to publish on-time performance.","apr",1218,0
93,"u","This is an important statistic used by some travelers to make choices about the carriers they wish to fly with.","apr",1218,1
94,"u","Also, the requirement to publish these statistics makes the carriers pay more attention to their achievements both individually and as compared to other carriers.","apr",1218,2
95,"e","I have a peanut allergy and do not fly on airplanes very often.","apr",678,0
96,"e","However, my husband and I took a trip that required flying for travel","apr",678,1
97,"u","and I was very worried about the peanuts.","apr",678,2
98,"e","I took over-the-counter medicine to prevent a reaction and was very careful during the trip.","apr",678,3
99,"u","I can be as careful as I need to be,","apr",678,4
100,"n","but I can't help what the people around me eat.","apr",678,5
101,"u","I think that the two best ideas are banning nuts  from all flights, or having nut-free flights available .","apr",678,6
102,"u","When discussing an epinephrine auto-injector, I feel there should be one on the plane as part of the medical equipment, but should only be used in an emergency situation.","apr",678,7
103,"e","My doctor to me that if I use the Epi Pen, I have a few minutes to get to a hospital so they can regulate the epinephrine that's just been injected into my body.","apr",678,8
104,"e","This advice has caused me not to use the Epi Pen when I know that I can't get to a hospital in a short amount of time.","apr",678,9
105,"u","To me foods items, like a nut crusted chicken and rice dish will not bother me the way peanuts will.","apr",678,10
106,"n","Peanut butter provides the same reaction,","apr",678,11
107,"n","so peanut butter crackers would be out"" with a nut-free ban.","apr",678,12
108,"n","Products containing peanut oil are a different matter.","apr",678,13
109,"e","My doctor explained that the protein that I'm allergic to is broken down in the ""oil"" form,","apr",678,14
110,"u","so foods cooked in peanut oil  do not bother me.","apr",678,15
111,"u","I think there should be no caps on amount airlines have to pay.","apr",1077,0
112,"u","I agree with the proposed required customer service rules.","apr",1079,0
113,"u","Full Prices should be fully disclosed up front,","apr",1080,0
114,"u","and the lowest price available should be disclosed.","apr",1080,1
115,"u","prices should not be increased after purchase.","apr",1080,2
116,"u","DOT should extend the tarmac delay rules to all flights in the US","apr",1081,0
117,"e","On a recent trip from Wa state to Michigan, every single flight  was late by at least a half hour, resulting in missed connections both ways.","apr",855,0
118,"u","When the airport is more than two hours away, notifying passengers of a potential half hour delay won't significantly change whether they head for the airport or not.","apr",855,1
119,"u","However, in retrospect, I would have LOVED to know the following when booking flights: 1 airline's yearly on time percentage; 2 airline's passenger satisfaction rating.","apr",855,2
120,"u","Personally, if I'm going to be treated like cattle, I'd just as soon be happy cattle.","apr",855,3
121,"u","Air travel has turned into such a frustrating exercise  that we look for reasons not to go air.","apr",855,4

124,"u","ricport, everyone is responsible for themselves AND their effects on others.","apr",257,0
125,"u","Airlines are NOT public spaces. If airlines ban peanuts, MANY passengers WILL bring their own peanuts on board ... as airlines cannot stop people from bringing their own snacks.","apr",677,0
126,"u","I am sympathetic to people with allergies,","apr",677,1
127,"u","but people with allergies need to be prepared with their medicine and then need to stop trying to impose their need on the 99% of the healthy  population.","apr",677,2
128,"u","* 30 minutes is too long;","apr",945,0
129,"n","you say the majority leave within 14 minutes","apr",945,1
130,"u","so set the beginning info as 15 minutes with 30 minute updates unless a resolution is known sooner.","apr",945,2
131,"u","* Specify notification be by all methods available at the airport involved, including ticket agents, with the customer additionally specifying how they are to be notified at home; email, phone, FAX.","apr",945,3
132,"u","* All commercial flights should be included.","apr",945,4
133,"u","* Include the primary reason: bad weather-locally; bad weather-enroute; bad weather at destination; etc.","apr",945,5
134,"u","Don't forget the obvious reasons they don't do better; no enlightened effective regulation; executive compensation; union rules; airport and FAA inefficiencies; monopoly status ; ultimately the bottom line .","apr",946,0
135,"u","Let's look at this logically:","apr",947,0
136,"n","The airline knows when they sell a ticket;","apr",947,1
137,"n","they know when they have sold the full number.","apr",947,2
138,"u","Those passengers should be guaranteed a seat; NO EXCUSES.","apr",947,3
139,"u","Any subsequent tickets sold should be sold as STANDBY with a ranking 1-n, first come; first served!","apr",947,4
140,"u","Problem solved.","apr",947,5
141,"u","If anyone wants to volunteer; use the approach below.","apr",947,6
142,"u","IF YOU DON'T WANT TO USE THE SIMPLE APPROACH!","apr",947,7
143,"u","* First ask for volunteers to receive the next available comparable or better seat on the airline or any other airline, the airline agents to make the arrangements and pay for the seat directly, the passenger to be reimbursed in cash or credit card for their anticipated out of pocket costs due to the delay and their total out of pocket flight costs, tickets, baggage checks, any other fees.","apr",947,8
144,"u","If points were used they would be reinstated with new expiration dates.","apr",947,9
145,"u","*  Do a lottery, no limits, with at least  the results in 1., above, cash or credit cards only;","apr",947,10
146,"u","NO VOUCHERS,","apr",947,11
147,"u","they're almost impossible to use.","apr",947,12
148,"u","* If they still bump someone the sky should be the limit, the results to be appropriate booking plus at least double  the payout in 2., above.","apr",947,13
149,"u","Of course airline lawyers would attempt to make it five pages of weasel words.","apr",947,14
150,"u","Disclosure, disclosure, disclosure!","apr",949,0
151,"u","Not just the ticket price but also the Agent's fee,","apr",952,0
152,"u","which sometimes is considerable.","apr",952,1
153,"u","And Yes! they should not be able to raise the quoted price.","apr",952,2
154,"u","It makes no sense and is misleading to quote a one way price if I have to buy a roundtrip ticket.","apr",954,0
155,"u","If the itemization is Boston to Bombay fare, then various fees, then Bombay to Boston fare and various fees, it is still misleading unless it is specifically preceded by ""Round Trip Required""","apr",954,1
156,"u","If I just want to go from Boston to Bombay and stay there or go  somewhere else, I shouldn't buy this ticket and I should know it ""up front"".","apr",954,2
157,"u","This whole process of additional regulation is brought about because of lack of disclosure by airlines and agents when they unbundle services and initiate obscene fees for them so that we buy tickets and still don't have a deal because we may still be hit by additional fees at checkin.","apr",955,0
158,"u","A DEAL SHOULD BE A DEAL!","apr",955,1
159,"u","Of course not.","apr",955,2
160,"u","I think we should always be talking about airlines, travel agents, and other resellers.","apr",957,0
161,"u","I think the smaller typeface is a bad idea.","apr",957,1
162,"u","Small type is always used for something the purveyor has to say but doesn't want us to be able to read, and we usually can't.","apr",957,2
163,"u","No!  Retroactive pricing is essentially fraud and violates the contract made when money changes hands.","apr",958,0
164,"u","I would favor a rule that disallowed even having a round trip requirement for prices.","apr",958,1
165,"u","If an airline wants to give a credit for roundtrip like stores give case discounts on groceries or such, and listed it as a separate credit in their advertising and on their ticket that might work.","apr",958,2
166,"u","Fares from Boston to New York might vary by time of day and by day of the week","apr",958,3
167,"u","but they should never be based on Round Trip Required.","apr",958,4
168,"u","This is the same as bumping and should be compensated  as such.","apr",959,0
169,"u","See my comments under that category.","apr",959,1
170,"u","It is not just the five hours,","apr",959,2
171,"u","though that is bad enough;","apr",959,3
172,"u","it is all the other inconveniences, arriving late at night, having to cancel engagements, having to call a cab for a long ride vs bus transportation, and a myriad other inconveniences for which the airlines in their hubris currently accepts no responsibility.","apr",959,4
173,"u","The price of fuel doesn't change while I am trying to book a flight.","apr",960,0
174,"u","Maybe airlines should only be allowed to change prices once a week, or once a day, always at midnight, or something like that.","apr",960,1
175,"u","It is extremely frustrating to try to buy a ticket and have availability and or or price change while you are pushing the ""Buy"" button.","apr",960,2
176,"u","Since all these airlines are still split on what services call for fees and how much those services actually cost, they need to create a standard for every airline to use as a basis for quoting prices.","apr",495,0
177,"u","Go back a few years to what was considered ""standard"", and have them quote on: - RT airfare- 1 checked bag- advance seat selection- beverage service- taxes and fees","apr",495,1
178,"u","From there, passengers can unbundle as necessary or add things like premium seating and 2nd or 3rd checked bags .","apr",495,2
179,"u","Rather than encourage airlines to hide all the extra fees, it would instead encourage them to promote their fees -- ""You can save $XXX if you don't check a bag and don't care where you sit!""","apr",495,3
180,"u","* Although perhaps an improvement over current procedures, this will only help a portion of peanut or nut allergic people, and mostly likely won't help severely allergic individuals.","apr",318,0
181,"n","* Airborne peanut or nut proteins can cause anaphylactic reactions faster than surface-bound peanut or nut proteins;","apr",318,1
182,"n","the recycled air in the plane exacerbates this problem.","apr",318,2
183,"n","* Every surface could still be contaminated, even if you wipe down your seats; for example, touching any other arm rest, using lavatory doors, toilets, sinks, and surfaces right after someone else who was eating peanuts or nuts.","apr",318,3
184,"u","* There would simply still be too many risks.","apr",318,4
185,"u","* Again, better than current procedures, and better than a buffer zone, but still a problem.","apr",318,5
186,"n","A peanut or nut allergic individual would likely be walking onto a plane that was not peanut or nut free 30 minutes prior;","apr",318,6
187,"n","and although some cleaning of the cabins occurs between flights,","apr",318,7
188,"n","many of the same issues mentioned above would still exist.","apr",318,8

190,"u","prior to having a son diagnosed with peanut or nut and soy allergies I didn't know what it entailed either;","apr",318,10

193,"u","* Although there may still be risks of passengers violating the policy,","apr",318,13
194,"n","this resolves all of the issues mentioned above.","apr",318,14
195,"u","The surfaces of and air inside the plane would be safe,","apr",318,15
196,"u","all travelers would know what to expect,","apr",318,16
197,"u","no one would know who was or wasn't peanut or nut allergic.","apr",318,17
198,"u","* Airlines have nothing to lose by instituting a full ban;","apr",318,18
199,"u","they only have customers to gain.","apr",318,19
200,"u","Like with any changes in air travel policy, if such a ban is universally instituted, everyone will have to accept it,","apr",318,20
201,"u","and it will not prevent people from continuing to fly.","apr",318,21
202,"u","However, what will happen is that a large and continuously growing part of the customer market that currently cannot or will not fly, will buy tickets knowing that air travel can be safe.","apr",318,22
203,"u","* Bear in mind the severity of a situation where a peanut or nut allergic individual goes into anaphylactic shock mid-air.","apr",318,23
204,"n","In some cases, Benadryl and an Epipen  will resolve the reaction for an amount of time.","apr",318,24

207,"u","Therefore, while the first two policy options may reduce risk to a degree,","apr",318,27

2746,"u","It is not particularly important to include snacks","apr",851,2

2749,"u","I am to the point where if I don't have to fly I won't","apr",851,5

2752,"u","Significant fees should be defined as those charged for something that is an essential part of the flight, i.e. seating, baggage, fuel,","apr",851,8

2872,"n","Jetblue can fly A to B for $89.","apr",916,9

2875,"u","It is difficult for me to accept sitting on the ground for 3 hours without being allowed out of the seat, no food, toilets overflowing, etc","apr",916,12

4606,"n","because the outside of the envelope does not state anywhere that it is from the Loan Servicers nor that it is important information regarding their mortgage.","ms",11,2
4607,"u","This means borrowers will likely overlook the notice no matter how well the letter is written.","ms",11,3
4608,"n","* No loan servicer's website currently allows a borrower to update their insurance information online.","ms",11,4
4609,"n","This can only be done via Assurant or QBE First's generic 3rd party websites.","ms",11,5
4610,"u","In today's digital age, there should be a way for borrowers to PROACTIVELY provide this information, rather than being guided toward a confusing unknown website.","ms",11,6
4611,"n","In the case of Wells Fargo, for example, a borrower would need to go to separate websites for their home and auto loan, since QBE First processes their auto insurance information, while Assurant processes their mortgage insurance information.","ms",11,7
4612,"u","This is confusing and unacceptable.","ms",11,8

4623,"n","The negative escrow accounts created by false placement of duplicate coverage are how Florida became one of the leading states for foreclosure.","ms",14,5
4624,"u","Remember that escrow accounts are PREPAID insurance accounts,","ms",14,6
4625,"n","so when a LPI policy is place, and the Loan Servicer processes an escrow analysis on the loan, the borrower is given 1 year to make up for 2 years of insurance payments.","ms",14,7
4626,"u","To make matters worse, the LPI premiums are inflated, and often backdated,","ms",14,8
4627,"u","so often the borrower is given much less time to make up for this negative escrow balance.","ms",14,9
4628,"u","If an escrow analysis is completed on a borrower with LPI, the premium can drive their monthly mortgage payment up by as much as 1000% to make up for this deficit.","ms",14,10

4745,"n","This automated process is relatively cost free for the institution and allows the borrowers to gain access to requested docs, and also information pertaining to servicing issues.","ms",48,2

4749,"u","From a technical standpoint, direct access to a loan servicer's web based client portal via a simple username or password is impractical.","ms",49,0
4750,"n","There are many technical settings, VPN's, etc that are set up when vendors access these.","ms",49,1
4751,"n","What they can do, however, is build the code and databases to allow borrowers to access this information via their consumer websites.","ms",49,2

4756,"u","The answers to my QWR were quite surprising.","ms",51,0
4757,"e","The servicer might argue they have too high of costs and burden to reply and that some are ""overly broad"".","ms",51,1
4758,"e","However, the servicer had no problem providing me pages and pages of payoff statement and payment history","ms",51,2
4759,"e","However, even after they wrote me that they checked the reinstatement fees and confirmed those as ""correct"" they cannot itemize even half of them.","ms",51,3
4760,"u","That would take one or two pages to print out and mail - much easier than the information they were willing to provide.","ms",51,4
4761,"u","That request was ""too broad"".","ms",51,5
4762,"u","So yes, the servicer can call too broad what ever they want to.","ms",51,6
4763,"u","I will now write a new QWR asking again for itemization of the fees.","ms",51,7
4764,"u","As a bank they should be able to find out how they themselves came up with that number -","ms",51,8
4765,"n","especially as they have checked them and confirmed in writing that they were correct.","ms",51,9
4766,"u","By the way - the confirmation about the fees being correct came in writing and a copy went to the CFPB.","ms",51,10
4767,"u","I don't believe I would have gotten an answer at all if I had not complained with the CFPB.","ms",51,11
4768,"u","And here is a suggestion for the servicer to cut cost:","ms",51,12
4769,"e","in pre-foreclosure we received a ""Home Transition Guide"" - magazine style and no doubt expensive to print and send that we really didn't care for.","ms",51,13
4770,"e","During the Hamp modification trial we received the same request for our tax returns via Fed Ex over and over again .","ms",51,14
4771,"e","Also, ten days after we reinstated, they send Fed Ex AGAIN with a note that we needed to short sale or give them the deed in lieu of foreclosure.","ms",51,15
4772,"u","One would think they own Fed Ex as much as they use it.","ms",51,16
4773,"u","Some servicers are either completely ineffective with internal communication or they really enjoy throwing money at Fed Ex.","ms",51,17
4774,"u","Also: the proposed clause ""for information it can't get from its records in the ""ordinary course of business"" with ""reasonable efforts"" is downright inviting fraud.","ms",51,18
4775,"u","They need the original promissory note with endorsements or allonge to assign it when the loan is transferred.","ms",51,19
4776,"n","Since the ordinary course of their business has become robo-signing,","ms",51,20
4777,"u","it makes it even easier to deny the request of a copy of the endorsed note.","ms",51,21
4778,"u","this exclusion would give them right to hide fees from their affiliates.","ms",51,22
4779,"u","That could make the game of inflated maintenance fees in foreclosure, force placed insurance, unearned kickback fees, attorney fees a whole new chance.","ms",51,23

4781,"u","the servicer already successfully denies to answer QWR that can be interpreted as nothing but harassment.","ms",51,25
4782,"u","No I don't.","ms",51,26
4783,"u","My conclusion is that the servicers just don't want to inform the consumers.","ms",51,27
4784,"n","In the year 2012 they can get all the information tied to a borrowers loan with a few strokes on the keyboard.","ms",51,28
4785,"u","Nothing too difficult.","ms",51,29
4786,"u","It is just that some information they DO NOT WANT TO GIVE.","ms",51,30
4787,"u","The CFPB's only role is to protect the consumer.","ms",51,31
4788,"u","They should not even have to worry about making it easier for or less costly for the servicer or the bank.","ms",51,32
4789,"u","My servicer chose to spend money on hiring a high profile law firm only to  answer my QWR entirely.","ms",51,33
4790,"u","Well - that is their choice.","ms",51,34
4791,"u","If the CFPB gives the servicers a pass on not giving information more than a year after a servicing transfer, it is IMPERATIVE that the rules for a full information servicing transfer are solid and enforced.","ms",53,0

4808,"n","For ""overbroad"" and ""unduly burdensome"" information or ""unreasonable volume of documents or information"" I have to point out that there are hundreds of employees at every servicer capable of creating queries that can be implemented and applied quite easily  to pull ANY and ALL loan information for a specific borrower.","ms",53,17
4809,"n","It can all be exported into a spreadsheet, PDF, image file, and more.","ms",53,18
4810,"u","It is a simple process and can be attached to the SQL GUI's utilized by every loan servicer with very minimal effort or cost to the servicer.","ms",53,19

4825,"u","For example, if the loan servicer has an email address available, after the 3 phone calls, they should be required to try 3 emails.","ms",56,2
4826,"u","Starting contact efforts 16 days out should be completely fine if a borrower opts in for text messaging.","ms",56,3
4827,"u","A simple text of ""Your mortgage payment is now due. Payment must be received by  to avoid any late fees or collection efforts. If you are unable to make your payment, please contact  at  for alternative options."" text would actually be a great customer service option.","ms",56,4
4828,"u","It may be good to mirror these after Fair Debt Collection practices.","ms",56,5
4829,"u","The servicing systems need to be updated  to ensure that once a borrower accepts a loss mitigation option, these notification options are properly updated.","ms",56,6
4830,"u","For example, there's no need to keep calling someone to say their payment is late if they've already begun the forebearance process,","ms",56,7
4831,"u","the loan term change should update the contact dates, etc.","ms",56,8
4832,"u","Also, if a borrower has a HELOC, 2nd mortgage, or is listed as a co-borrower any other property, they should all be considered together at the time of the initial call.","ms",56,9
4833,"u","These accounts should all be linked so that a borrower facing default on 3 loans for the same property is not overwhelmed, confused, etc.","ms",56,10
4834,"u","The written notice approach seems like it'll work.","ms",57,0
4835,"u","The samples are as clear as they can be.","ms",57,1
4836,"u","Most borrowers won't understand any of it anyway.","ms",57,2
4837,"u","The biggest thing is to ensure they know who they can contact and making sure the c or s reps are fully trained on proper options and disclosures.","ms",57,3
4838,"u","I would definitely recommend that a written notice of confirmation is sent to the borrower for any changes made to their account as well.","ms",57,4
4839,"n","While it may not fully assist them,","ms",57,5

4843,"n","This technology is built into loan servicing software suites,","ms",57,9
4844,"u","and if a company can't afford loan servicing software, they really have no business servicing loans.","ms",57,10
4845,"u","Just like with banking statements, a borrower should have the option to opt in for paperless.","ms",59,0
4846,"n","If they do, everything can be handled via the web, and email or text notifications can be sent.","ms",59,1
4847,"u","These notifications should contain the exact same information as the paper statement.","ms",59,2
4848,"n","They would just be received earlier","ms",59,3
4849,"n","since there's no physical mail involved.","ms",59,4
4850,"n","Again, since everything can be done electronically,","ms",59,5
4851,"u","there needs to be a way for borrowers to view or update their insurance information electronically through the loan servicer, without having to go to Assurant or QBE's highly deceptive websites.","ms",59,6
4852,"u","If a borrower doesn't want electronic access, that is their choice.","ms",59,7
4853,"n","Servicers such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and JPMorgan already have websites set up.","ms",59,8

4855,"u","This addresses nothing in my example.","ms",61,0
4856,"e","They notified me of LMO's but then hid the fact they applied extra risk percentage of 2.5%, meaning the NPV caluculated by my using the HAMP site did not match the NPV value they came up with, since Wells Fargo was adding unbeknown to consumers 2.5% risk to the prime.","ms",61,1
4857,"u","Telling them all the LMO's means nothing if they do not have full disclosures on the numbers used in the NPV model their calculations, and their deteminations.","ms",61,2
4858,"u","They should not be able to disqualify anyone from a LMO unless they fully disclose all the calculations used to determine that disqualification.","ms",61,3
4859,"u","The lender should not be able to place forced insurance and replace the primary titled owner as the beneficiary of any loss policy issued on an pre forclosure asset,","ms",63,0
4860,"u","until forclosure occurs, the DEED is and remains in the ownership under homestead laws of most states, the borrower's legal property.","ms",63,1
4861,"u","I can understand the insurance requirement.","ms",63,2
4862,"u","The borrower should not be required to assume debt, that defies market logic,and then be liable for that debt being issued when they can derive no direct benefit from it, not even policy ownership.","ms",63,3
4863,"u","Also the lender should be required to obtain insurance at prevailing fair market insurance rates the regular consumer pays at the very most,","ms",63,4
4864,"e","when I was forced into REO due to default, and on medical disability, the monthly insurance cost was three times the annual cost of my then existing annual allstate policy cost.","ms",63,5
4865,"e","Which had also had additonal riders including liability umbrellas, for my auto and additional personal medical for visitors, comprehensive platinum content coverage,","ms",63,6
4866,"u","it belies common sense that they be allowed to fleece and abuse already indigent homeowners, like that. Charging 3 times what my full policy costs in a year, in a single month, and not even convering the whole contents of the house.","ms",63,7
4867,"u","They should have to use and provide traditional carrier insurance throught market channels at prevailing fair market insurance rates for the property,","ms",63,8
4868,"u","the policy should be CO-owned with both borrower and lender listed as beneficiaries of any REO policy especially if being billed to the escrow account,","ms",63,9
4869,"u","anything less is the abuse of the fiduciary of escrow.","ms",63,10
4870,"e","I had no problem blindly insuring my house with my current carrier from six states away,","ms",63,11
4871,"e","in fact they knew the number of claims ever filed on the property being insured as well as any claims I had filed on the property I owned prior to this one.","ms",63,12
4872,"u","All of this over inflation claim of excessive risk on REO insurance is a scam designed to insure they overcome the bankruptcy discount on cram downs.","ms",63,13

4874,"u","There is NO reason for it.","ms",63,15
4875,"n","REO and Force-Placed Insurance are 2 different products.","ms",64,0
4876,"u","The REO policy shouldn't have a borrower's name as the beneficiary because it is placed on a property post-foreclosure,","ms",64,1
4877,"u","however, you are 100% correct that these policies should NOT be charged to the borrower's escrow account ,","ms",64,2
4878,"u","and a borrower should NOT be held responsible for any REO charges whatsoever.","ms",64,3
4879,"n","Currently, escrow accounts are systematically added to EVERY foreclosure.","ms",64,4
4880,"n","The point it happens is dependent on the state and whether the lender is FNMA, FMAC, or other.","ms",64,5
4881,"n","These illegally created escrow accounts are illegally saddled with exorbitant MONTHLY REO premiums,","ms",64,6
4882,"n","which end up being charged to the borrower, NOT the lender.","ms",64,7
4883,"u","This is also an example of rampant racketeering and mortgage abuse,","ms",64,8

4885,"u","No, It doesn't.","ms",65,0
4886,"n","The new industry practice is that loss Mitigation or modifications are to be offered IF it is financially better for the INVESTOR to modify the homeowner instead of foreclosing, a positive net present value.","ms",65,1
4887,"u","But the proposed rules are just a delay for Wall Street to continue business as usual with no regard for fairness or equality, when there were over 5 million modifications issued to avoid the investors fiancial loss when negative equity was involved, setting the new industry practice or legal precedent what is offered in the normal course of business for negative equity homeowners.","ms",65,2

4979,"e","In several of our firms' cases major servicers have claimed they could not offer a loan modification to our our clients' because there was an ""investor restriction.""","ms",111,3
4980,"u","This would be valid if it were true,","ms",111,4
4981,"n","as investors are not required to to consent to a modification.","ms",111,5
4982,"n","However, oftentimes this is just an excuse the servicers use to keep a client in default and to keep raking in fees that benefit themselves","ms",111,6
4983,"n","investor's usually recieve principle and interest,","ms",111,7
4984,"n","while servicers recieve all the late fees, and other fees associated with servicing an account.","ms",111,8
4985,"u","There are few cases when there is a legitamite investor restriction.","ms",111,9
4986,"e","Anytime a servicer cites one, I ask for the name of the investor and the name and series of the trust the mortgage was probably pooled into.","ms",111,10
4987,"e","Then, if the trust is public I look it up on the SEC website t_url","ms",111,11
4988,"e","Then I open the Pooling and servicing agreement section which pertains to modifications.","ms",111,12
4989,"e","In 95% of cases the agreement petween the investor and the servicer gives the servicer the ability to recapitalize loans, reduce interest and or or reduce princible as they see fit.","ms",111,13
4990,"e","Oftentime the servicer is already modifying other loans within the portfolio in the same trust.","ms",111,14

4992,"e","When confronted with written proof that there is in fact no investor restriction, or that the restriction has been waived servicers will often retract their claim that there is a restriction.","ms",111,16
4993,"e","But then they often come up with another illegitamate excuse such as a modification denial due to NPV , or that the client needs to have their second mortgage subordinated .","ms",111,17
4994,"u","The problem is that few ordinary homeowners have the education or resources to push back against servicers.","ms",111,18
4995,"u","If the investors found out that their servicers were tanking their portfolio by not agreeing to profitable modifications  they would be outraged.","ms",111,19

5076,"u","I think bankruptcy should not be used as an excuse to abuse homeowners who have already suffered enough.","ms",127,5

5174,"u","Especially with the currently low rates , ideally a prospective customer should perform a ""stress-test"" on their own financial situation, and ask realistically could they afford the loan if rates climb in the long term, and specifically how they would accomplish this.","ms",145,3
5175,"u","An alert is nice,","ms",145,4
5176,"u","but the options are far greater before the agreement is signed.","ms",145,5
5177,"u","Therefore, my recommendation would be to put equal--or greater--emphasis on clear communication and discussion of options before the loans are signed, with a focus on worst-case increases.","ms",145,6
5178,"u","e.g. ""If rates do climb substantially, and your ARM rate goes to it's highest allowed level of __X%__, your monthly payment would be __$xx,xxx__.","ms",145,7
5179,"u","Even if the prospective customer doesn't provide an answer to the loan officer, that might trigger some very useful discussions among spouses, co-signers, etc","ms",145,8
5180,"u","I assume that lenders would detest such a requirement,","ms",145,9
5181,"u","but fundamentally we do need to enforce reality-checks at some stage:","ms",145,10
5182,"u","history and basic logic indicate that the people who are paid to generate loans are not the best guardians of long-term risk.","ms",145,11
5183,"u","i.e. how much of an increase could you really afford.","ms",145,12
5184,"u","Requiring a prospective borrower do the math might be a useful reality check -","ms",145,13
5185,"u","even if the person fudges the numbers, at least the issue will have been implanted in their head.","ms",145,14
5186,"u","Let me first give you some background","ms",147,0
5187,"u","so you can fully understand what has happened.","ms",147,1
5188,"e","My partner developed cancer without medical insurance.","ms",147,2
5189,"e","This catastrophic event eventually led me into bankruptcy.","ms",147,3
5190,"e","My partner died 3 weeks before I recieved the Chapter 7 discharge.","ms",147,4
5191,"e","Three weeks AFTER the discharge, I signed permanent HAMP modification documents that lowered the payment on my house.","ms",147,5
5192,"e","Even though it is well over $100,000 underwater,","ms",147,6
5193,"e","it is still my home","ms",147,7
5194,"u","and I want to keep it.","ms",147,8
5195,"e","My servicer honored the permanent agreement","ms",147,9
5196,"e","and I paid my mortgage every month for over a year with no issues.","ms",147,10
5197,"e","My servicer provided online access as well as monthly statements.","ms",147,11
5198,"e","the monthly statements have a disclaimer at the bottom that read: ""Aurora Bank is a debt collector.","ms",147,12
5199,"e","Aurora Bank is attampting to collect a debt","ms",147,13
5200,"e","and any information obtained will be used for that purpose.","ms",147,14
5201,"e","However, if you are in bankruptcy or received a bankruptcy dischagre of the debt, this communication is not an attempt to collect the debt agaiinst you personall, but is notice of a possible enforcement of the lien against the collateral property.""","ms",147,15
5202,"e","This statement protects the servicer against any automatic stay violations,","ms",147,16
5203,"e","it's standard throughout the industry.","ms",147,17
5204,"e","I was lucky to recieve a HAMP mod and was one of the success stories about HAMP.","ms",147,18
5205,"e","But suddenly Aurora closed,","ms",147,19
5206,"e","and the servicing rights went to a non-bank company.","ms",147,20
5207,"e","This is after over a year of success.","ms",147,21
5208,"e","The new servicer is the one not providing statements.","ms",147,22
5209,"e","They quote ""It is our policy to deny online access to accounts and will not provide mortgage statements to anyone who has had a bankruptcy and did not reaffirm the loan"".","ms",147,23
5210,"u","So this is not about violating any bankruptcy law,","ms",147,24
5211,"u","they simply choose to not cooperate, or worse are trying to leverage the statement information to get people to reaffirm!","ms",147,25
5212,"e","No bankruptcy judge would reaffirm a mortgage that was $100,000 underwater at the time.","ms",147,26
5213,"u","The judges go out of their way to not approve reaffirmation agreements because it is not in the best interest of the debtor. Simple as that.","ms",147,27
5214,"u","So the new servicer could easily just pick up where the old servicer left off,","ms",147,28
5215,"u","but they refuse based on their own unfair policy.","ms",147,29
5216,"u","Perhaps because they make more money on defaulting loans,","ms",147,30
5217,"u","they keep the fees","ms",147,31
5218,"u","and the investor gets what's leftover after a foreclosure sale.","ms",147,32
5219,"u","So if they make it difficult for the homeowner, many will just give up and walk away.","ms",147,33
5220,"u","The servicer then gets the ""fees"" after the sale.","ms",147,34
5221,"u","Also the non-bank servicer does not have to answer to most Government Financial regulations,","ms",147,35
5222,"n","the FDIC, Treasury, Office of Currency Comptroller do not oversee non-banks, so there is no way to file a complaint with them.","ms",147,36
5223,"u","I was lucky to find CFPB,","ms",147,37
5224,"u","I just pray you can intervene not only for me, but the many thousands more out there suffering though this latest nightmare.","ms",147,38
5225,"u","So in summary, a simple disclaimer is all the servicer needs for bankruptcy cases,","ms",147,39
5226,"u","The rules you propose still do not protect bankruptcy cases","ms",147,40
5227,"u","because the servicer is not required to include a disclaimer so the bankrupt homeowner can keep getting statements.","ms",147,41
5228,"u","Same with online accounts.","ms",147,42
5229,"u","This MAJOR servicer has found a loophole and is exploiting it.","ms",147,43
5230,"u","Here's a suggestion,","ms",147,44
5231,"u","maybe you could propose a rule that the servicer shall make a good faith effort to help homeowners with bankruptcies stay in their homes by offering statements with the standard disclosure phrase.","ms",147,45
5232,"u","By accepting the terms of the online agreement and the monthly statement, the homeowner would agree that it is not a viloation of the automatic stay.","ms",147,46
5233,"u","It's sad that I find myself battling a servicer a year after everything was stabilized.","ms",147,47
5234,"u","I am tired of fighting.","ms",147,48
5235,"u","I think this is a reasonable solution.","ms",149,0
5236,"u","Homeowners should be able to get answers over the phone,","ms",149,1
5237,"u","but then the servicer should be required to ask if they would like a written confirmation of the information.","ms",149,2
5238,"u","Of course, the homeowner should say ""yes, please"".","ms",149,3
5239,"u","People will not take your opinions seriously if you are derogatory.","ms",150,0
5240,"u","The problem with all of this is that the consumer doesn't understand all of the parties involved in his or her loan and might need that information in the case of a financial crisis of some kind.","ms",153,0
5241,"u","In addition to the servicer of the loan there is the question of who actually owns the loan","ms",153,1
5242,"u","and, if the loan has been bundled into some sort of security, perhaps the borrower should know that as well.","ms",153,2
5243,"u","Lack of clear records in this regard was exposed as a major problem during the 2008 crisis.","ms",153,3
5244,"u","So it seems to me that whenever any change occurs in any of the above, the mortgagee should receive a clear, concise picture of the situation.","ms",153,4
5245,"n","This is the organization to whom you actually owe the money. .and so on and so forth.","ms",153,5
5246,"u","A similar form should be sent when there's a change.","ms",153,6
5247,"u","each mortgage loan should have a unique universal identifier so things can be tracked properly.","ms",153,7
5248,"u","I.e., when a loan is packaged and sold in a structured security, the paperwork would have the unique IDs of all loans included in the package.","ms",153,8
5249,"u","Dear Moderator, As you may know, it has been the common public practice of bank regulators to listen to complaints from foreclosure fraud victims and respond by attempts at misdirection.","ms",156,0
5250,"u","Like children's birthday party magicians regulators halfheartedly attempt to distract their audience with a shiny object in one hand, such as information management proposals, while looking away from the truth of Wall Street prosecution failure in the other.","ms",156,1
5251,"n","This has become so common place in local hearings and legislative testimony it has spawned new phrases into the English language such as ""Regulatory Theater"" and ""Enforcement Fraud"".","ms",156,2
5252,"u","I support error correction.","ms",156,3
5253,"n","But error correction only corrects errors, not deceptive practices.","ms",156,4
5254,"u","A substantive response from the CFPB would have addressed Page 27 of the mutli-state lawsuit and advised when homeowners will be able to call their state attorney general or the CFPB to stop a deceptive foreclosure in progress.","ms",156,5
5255,"u","Homeowner's insurance should have a guaranteed re-issue policy in place for the mortgage servicer.","ms",157,0
5256,"u","The rate should be no more than the insurance cost in prior year.","ms",157,1
5257,"u","The mortgage servicer should be required to use this guaranteed re-issue policy.","ms",157,2

5559,"u","* For most small to mid-size lenders the actual statements are outsourced to a third party due to the cost of creating something in house.","ms",245,0

5561,"u","In a time of ever shrinking margins  this is a cost that just cannot be easily absorbed.","ms",245,2
5562,"u","* If the CFPB is going to require changes to a statement they should create a safe harbor format to shield FI's from being sued by lawyers looking to make money and not protect consumers.","ms",245,3
5563,"e","As someone who has been in the industry for well over a quarter I can give some insight here.","ms",246,0
5564,"u","For a small to midsize lender the mortgages will often be stored on a system that is not connected in real time to your core processing system.","ms",246,1

5566,"u","It's not meant to be secretive","ms",246,3

5568,"u","I am against having oral and written requests being treated equally.","ms",246,5
5569,"u","Written requests have, by their nature, a more formal stature and create a paper trail.","ms",246,6

5581,"u","If PMI is required, then the home owner should be able to  shop for the best rate.","ms",257,3
5582,"u","If PMI is mandatory then it should be listed and broken down on the statement that we are discussing.","ms",257,4
5583,"u","Banks need to be removed from insurance where it appears they commit massive fraud so banks will  return to focusing on loaning money.","ms",257,5
5584,"u","The home owner should shop for the PMI best rate to protect their loan because ultimately they are paying for it.","ms",257,6
5585,"u","The homeowner should shop for the best price they can find on structure insurance based on replacement value of the structure including wind or hurricane or flood or fire or water damage, on a need basis and subtract the value of the land for replacement insurance.","ms",257,7
5586,"u","Structure and PMI insurance is considered part of the monthly house payment just like interest and principle.","ms",257,8
5587,"u","This keeps what is mandatory to secure a loan to a minimum so homes will not be lost due to over priced insurance any longer.","ms",257,9
5588,"u","Nobody should loose their home because they are paying for optional items either.","ms",257,10
5589,"u","There is an easy solution for this.","ms",257,11
5590,"u","If the homeowner wants insurance for theft, personal injury or house content then this is handled directly between the homeowner and the insurance company if they can afford it","ms",257,12

5592,"u","Basically moderator, separating minimum priced mandatory bank insurance from optional insurance is crucial and could make the difference from making a house payment or not.","ms",257,14
5593,"u","Mandatory insurance should be in the name of the bank and homeowner.","ms",257,15
5594,"u","Optional insurance should be in the home owners name and paid directly from the home owner to the insurance company if they can afford optional insurance.","ms",257,16

5847,"u","I am concerned about underwriters being overwhelmed by calls from clients and understand how difficult it is to constantly be interrupted while trying to review detailed information...","ms",341,0
5848,"u","however; the reps also interrupt the underwriters to find out information for clients and counselors","ms",341,1
5849,"u","so it wastes time adding a 3rd person to the mix when the information at hand is critical to the decision making process.","ms",341,2
5850,"u","I don't think the average turn around time for evaluation decisions is accurate.","ms",341,3
5851,"u","so they are able to accurately complete the evaluation.","ms",341,4
5852,"u","Instead, clients must re-apply from the beginning which wastes time that could be spent on new client applications, and prolongs the foreclosure process.","ms",341,5
5853,"u","My suggestion would be for clients to have a SPOC for both inbound and outbound communication, and for the housing counselors to have direct contact with underwriters with the understanding that housing counselors will be contacted for any needed information or decisions BEFORE client files are closed in order to avoid declines based upon missing information, misunderstandings, or the reasons stated previously.","ms",341,6
5854,"u","In response to the EXCLUSIONS mentioned in  and the process of UPDATING BORROWERS, I recommend it to be updated as so...","ms",343,0

5857,"u","My point is simple,","ms",343,3
5858,"u","lenders DECIDE to sell the service, to who or why is irrelevant,","ms",343,4
5859,"u","what is important is that they must retain some form of record that creates a paper trail that can be followed by any competent individual, especially the mortgagor.","ms",343,5
5860,"u","In response, the CFPB is surely on the right track","ms",344,0
5861,"u","and I understand that added stress on the company,","ms",344,1

5863,"u","As mentioned in the TIME FRAME allocated to such a transfer, 15 days in my eyes is short and should be at least 30-45 days.","ms",344,3
5864,"u","Why, simple...most mortgagor's pay their mortgages ""Once every month"",","ms",344,4
5865,"u","so what is happening is that the burden of making an adjustment in 15 days is left to the mortgagor","ms",344,5

5867,"u","As a mortgagor, I would ""ALWAYS INVESTIGATE"" any or all changes to who recieves my payments,","ms",344,7

5881,"u","If the servicer does not know about the itemization and current standing of the consumers account, well then they need to apply some sort of system that allows them to maintain these records...","ms",345,7
5882,"u","asking the consumer to pay for it, is just ridiculous.","ms",345,8
5883,"u","This is similar as to asking a local community, to pay for the construction, permits, taxes, infastructure and other costs to open a McDonalds on the corner.","ms",345,9

6181,"u","Please make rules which are based on the legal contractual obligation between the borrower and the lender, not based upon a feel good approach that views lenders and loan servicers as evil and borrowers as angels that are never in the wrong and  have no responsibilities to live up to.","ms",277,8

6238,"u","I get real nervous, when you talk about a ""new disclosure system by attorneys, rather than ORDINARY people"".","ms",315,35
6239,"u","What is even more scary is your solution for the question that we are currently discussing that addresses not being able to get information from your lender.","ms",315,36
6240,"n","Your solution talks about the CFPB's worry about ""the risk of overloading consumers with too much information"".","ms",315,37

6243,"u","but after reading some of his amazing papers I would love to know what he has to say about this.","ms",315,40
6244,"u","My opinion is, you don't limit borrowers information further to reduce crime and increase transparency.","ms",315,41
6245,"u","The ordinary people should not have to pay out any money to get information on your loan","ms",315,42
6246,"u","it should be provided monthly.","ms",315,43
6247,"n","Look at the earnings of the largest servicers even with all the lawsuits","ms",315,44
6248,"u","and you should agree they need to start offering service for their earnings.","ms",315,45
6249,"n","A couple of entries a month is hardly a burden for this amount of wealth the banks are generating from the ordinary","ms",315,46
6250,"u","and the banks probably cannot even believe they are getting away with providing such little detail.","ms",315,47

6255,"u","Warning a borrower about force placed insurance is irrelevant to addressing the problem, symptom or solution.","ms",318,0
6256,"u","After reading your link to 2024.37 force placed insurance 2viii I realized that the only solution that is being offered for all the force placed insurance issues is that the banks have to tell the borrower that they are about to place a force placed hazard insurance policy on them that ""cost significantly more"".","ms",318,1
6257,"u","In other words, if you can't make your property insurance payment, our solution is to increase the price of the insurance.","ms",318,2
6258,"u","Providing a borrower a written statement that you are going to take advantage of them is not the solution but part of the problem.","ms",318,3

6260,"u","with over priced insurance, that is going to make their problems much worse, and may prevent the chance of any recovery.","ms",318,5
6261,"u","Providing it in writing, mandated by the CFPB  just means that the government approves of this behavior,","ms",318,6
6262,"u","which makes the pain even worse.","ms",318,7
6263,"u","This is deplorable!","ms",318,8
6264,"u","That is like saying, if you don't send in your $100.00 electric bill payment on time, we are going to charge you $500.00 per month for electric instead","ms",318,9
6265,"u","and we are going to add a creepy middle man, to share in our electricity scam that ""cost significantly more"".","ms",318,10

6269,"u","and only insure the structure for the bank at the lowest price possible.","ms",318,14
6270,"u","Allow the bank to place this on auto pay monthly and charge the homeowner interest on this amount just like their home loan.","ms",318,15
6271,"n","If home is 3.5% interest then 3.5% on the insurance balance paid out monthly on auto pay.","ms",318,16
6272,"u","If the combined balance at the bank between principle, interest and property insurance ever equals 3 months behind then foreclosure is an option.","ms",318,17
6273,"u","If the bank cannot continue the same policy then they have to find one at the same price or lower.","ms",318,18
6274,"u","Remember this policy has a lot less things it covers because the homeowner side is removed","ms",318,19
6275,"u","so it actuality  is still considered ""significantly more"" at the same price because it covers less categories now and nobody has addressed this.","ms",318,20
6276,"u","If you kick people when they are down instead of helping them up or just not kicking them and see if they can get up on their own is a better option.","ms",318,21

6279,"e","This is some of the things that happened to me and or my friend.","ms",318,24
6280,"n","As shocking as this was, it is even more shocking that  the CFPB just wants banks to notify borrowers that they are about to be kicked them while they are down as a solution.","ms",318,25
6281,"u","Trust me all borrowers have friends that have already been kicked","ms",318,26
6282,"u","and they don't need a warning because they know what's coming","ms",318,27

6284,"u","I agree with peekaboo that servicers large and small provide poor service,","ms",336,0
6285,"u","and so the size may not be the deciding factor on quality of servicing.","ms",336,1
6286,"n","But since there is not fiduciary duty between the borrower and the servicer, the quality of service to the borrower is simply ""voluntary"" at best.","ms",336,2
6287,"u","The servicers have a duty to the Investor, and do not work for the borrower.","ms",336,3
